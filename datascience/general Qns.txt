2.normal distribusion :We know, in a normal distribution, ~68% of the data lies in 1 standard deviation from mean (or mode, median), which leaves ~32% of the data unaffected as missing values.
mean , median ,mode lies on same data point.

3. model is suffering from low bias and high variance:
1.Use regularization technique, where higher model coefficients get penalized, hence lowering model complexity.
2.Use top n features from variable importance chart. May be, with all the variable in the data set, the algorithm is having difficulty in finding the meaningful signal.
3. use bagging algorithm (like random forest) to tackle high variance problem
4.What is the difference between covariance and correlation?
Answer: Correlation is the standardized form of covariance.
Covariances are difficult to compare. For example: if we calculate the covariances of salary ($) and age (years), we’ll get different covariances which can’t be compared because of having unequal scales. To combat such situation, we calculate correlation to get a value between -1 and 1, irrespective of their respective scale.
5.What cross validation technique would you use on time series data set? Is it k-fold or LOOCV?
6.An event is simply the outcome of a random experiment.,sample space is nothing but the collection of all possible outcomes of an experiment
