naive baies :“Naive” i.e not correlated to each other. probability of estimator is not taken seroiusly!.
bais thream:
p(a/b)=p(a)*p(b/a)/p(b)
Max(P(feature|h).P(h))

1.find the frequncy table with each fature and target varible with that find probability-distributions.
2.

1.Bernoulli NB: You then build a feature that captures this as 0 if it’s not present and 1 if it is. The algorithm will use this concept to classify emails as spam/ham 

2.Multinomial : Similarly as before, we notice that the more dollar signs ($) there are in an email, the more likely that email is spam.

3.Gaussian : data should be continues and normally distributed.

4.Why is naive Bayes so ‘naive?
naive Bayes is so ‘naive’ because it assumes that all of the features in a data set are equally important and independent. As we know, these assumption are rarely true in real world scenario.

5.prior probability:


6.likelihood and marginal likelihood: likelihood is probability of predicting 1 or 0 in binary classification. marginal likelihood is probability of happening any of the data to 1 or 0.

7.how to handle Zero frequncy in naive bayes-classifier: add 1 insterd of 0 place in table or Laplace smoothing.

8.Laplace smoothing: probability of getting a word in corpus is 1 then it addeds prior 1 to numarator and total number of values to denominator.https://medium.com/syncedreview/applying-multinomial-naive-bayes-to-nlp-problems-a-practical-explanation-4f5271768ebf

9.The difference is that while MultinomialNB works with occurrence counts, BernoulliNB is designed for binary/boolean features.
