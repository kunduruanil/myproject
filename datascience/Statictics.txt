when you have outlayers median we can use.

normal distribution:
1. 65%data lys in mean+/- one sd,95% lys mean +/- 2sd , 98% data lys in mean +/- 3sd 
2. using z score we can say prapanulity of any values if data is distributed normally. using z table or pnorn(x,mean,sd)(r code)
3. how to check data is normally distributed or not using normal quantile plot. qqnorn(feature_colunm) (quantile quantile plot)
4. what to do when data is not follow normal distribution : do log(feature) if after log if data falls normal than proced else try exponational transformation else recepocal tranfermation else 
square root tranfermation else 1/square root tranfermation else go with non normal distribution algorithms.

sample variance:
taking random values from data set and mean will be random values.

central limit theorem:
1. if a population follows normal distribution then sample also follows normal distribution.
2. if population not follow normal than sample is normal if data is fairly larger. 
standard error- varibelity between samples will be mesured using 


confidence intervel:
1. prapanulity of simgle value is zero, so we come up with confidence intervel with some accuracy.
sample mean +/- z(value for confidence percentage) * standard error (sd for population/square-root of smaple size)
z value at 95% confidence is 1.96 and 90% is 1.64,99% is 2.58

type 1 error : action should not taken but taken.
type 2 error : action should take but not taken.

Hypothesis Testing:
1. null hypothesis.
2. alternate hypothesis.
