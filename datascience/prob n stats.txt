probability :

1. Experiment , event, outcome(random varible) . Liklyhood of happenning event in experiment . 0-1.
2. Binominal Distribution : p(x=k)=nck*p^k*q^n-k. n=number of events can happen, k= positive events , p= probability of positive events , q=probability of negative events.
3. Central Limit Theorem - ( mean-sd ,mean+sd)=65% , (mean-2sd,mean+2sd) = 95%. more numarical Data more normally distributed.
4. Events – Union, Intersection & Disjoint events.
5. Independent, Dependent & Exclusive Events : 
    Independent:If the occurrence of event A doesn’t affect the occurrence of event B, these events are called independent events.
    dependent 
	Dependent : if a card is taken from 52 cards than n will be 51 it is dependent event.
	Mutually exclusive and Exhaustive events:Mutually exclusive events are those events where two events cannot happen together. toss a coin will get head and tail at a time?
6.  Conditional Probability : will apply for depenent events . probability of B event given A happended is p(B/A)=p(A and B)/P(A). and - reverse U. multiplication p(A)*p(B).
7.  Reversing the condition: if we know p(A/B) and need to find p(B/A) in that case need to go for Byes therom.https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/conditional-probability-bayes-theorem/
8. Bayes Theorem : p(A/B)=p(B/A)*P(A)/p(B) derived from condisinal probability.

9. probability Distribution measure : https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/6-probability-distributions-data-science/
	1.The probabilities for discrete distributions are found using PMFs:"probability mass function " 
	exp: Binomial, Hypergeometric, Poisson, Geometric, Negative Binomial, etc…
	2.The probabilities for continuous distributions are found using PDFs:"probability density funtion"
	exp:Exponential, Gamma, Pareto, Normal, Lognormal, Student’s T, F, etc…
10 .How random variables & probability distributions are used in data science?
11. permutation: arrangements of a given number of elements  6p3=6!/3! (n!/(n-r)!).
12. combination : selecting of a given number of elements. 6c3=6!/3!*3* (n!/(n-r)!*r!).

Descriptive Statistics: A descriptive statistic is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information. 

1. Types of Variable : Dependent varible (target varible) , independent varibles.
   Categorical and Continuous Variables : categorical : nominal , ordinal, ratio , interval . continuous : infinate , timeseries .
2.mean , median , mode .
3. remove of outlayers . Inter-quartile range (IQR) == Q3-Q1 exp: n=10 than Q1=3rd index values after sorted. (box plot)
Upper outliers: Q3+1.5 ·IQR
Lower outliers: Q1–1.5 ·IQR  
4. filling missing values.
5.Uni-variate Analysis : For nominal variables, a frequency table and a listing of the mode(s) is sufficient , graph and find "skewness of graph",pia chat , bar graph ect.
6.Bi-variate Distribution : corelation for continuous varibles pearson corelation, plot scatter plot for corelation. (Z-test and t-test)
categorical varibles: mosaic plot is common (also chi-square test).
7.Multi-variate Analysis: . Multi-variate scatter plot, grouped box-plot (or grouped violin-plot), heat-map are used for multi-variate analysis.
8.Function Models :  linear function has the same average rate of change on every interval,Exponential functions have variable appears as the exponent (or power) instead of the base f(x)=2^x


Inferential Statistics :Inferential statistics allows you to make inferences about the population from the sample data

1.Population & Sample:The best technique for reducing bias in sampling is randomization.
Central Limit Theorem

2.The Central Limit Theorem is used to help us understand the following facts regardless of whether the population distribution is normal or not:
	1. the mean of the sample means is the same as the population mean
	2. the standard deviation of the sample means is always equal to the standard error.
	3. the distribution of sample means will become increasingly more normal as the sample size increases.

3.Confidence Intervals:

diffrent kind of Anlytics:
1.Descriptive analytics: deatails above
2.Inferential statistical analysis infers properties about a population ,it includes testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.
3.Predictive analytics:In business, predictive models exploit patterns found in historical and transactional data to identify risks and opportunities.
4.Prescriptive analytics:This type of analytics explains the step-by-step process in a situation. 
5.Associative Analysis:2 or more varibles associated systamatic way?
