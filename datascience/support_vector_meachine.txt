Larger Margin Classification: if c is large than it is bais to outlayers. 

cost funtion : https://towardsdatascience.com/optimization-loss-function-under-the-hood-part-iii-5dff33fa015d
     C*sum(y*cost1(W.T*X)+(1-y)cost0(W.T*X))+rezularization(1/2*sum(W**2))) if c=1/lamda them svm cost and logistic will be same.
	 
hypothasis:
h(x) = f(x)>=0 than 1 else 0


support vectors are vectors that touches edges of data points, if 2 classes than 2 support vectors will form and it will find vector which is maximisus distance
from support vectors for finding best vector.

kernals are used for non linear data points to make linearaly separible.
