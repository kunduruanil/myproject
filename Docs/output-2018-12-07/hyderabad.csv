Because of his work in shaping the Indian banking sector and other path-breaking research with a significant societal impact, Subramanian was named ISB’s inaugural Alumni Endowment Research Fellow in 2014.
Even while still earning his MBA and PhD, he produced award-winning work. Subramanian’s PhD dissertation earned the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Dissertation Fellowship, which recognises the top 15 PhD dissertations across all disciplines every year.

Hyderabad: One of the biggest help for any entrepreneur is the chance to network. And this is what IT Minister K T Rama Rao’s pet project T-Hub has been able to provide to emerging startups in Telangana.
The startup engine, a brainchild of Rama Rao, has over the last three years been able to provide all kinds of support to startups through its ecosystem, ranging from networking to mentoring and funding, apart from physical space and any other help that a startup would need.
With the dream of making Hyderabad a global city, the Minister along with representatives from academia and corporates set up the first building of T-Hub in November 2015. And over three years, T-Hub transformed itself into an ecosystem of its own. Modern infrastructure, global events and innovative startups form the basis of this ecosystem that is growing each day.
“When we were discussing the idea of T-Hub, we barely had 200 startups in Hyderabad. This has gone up to over 2,000 in just three years. Not only this, the whole ecosystem has changed from just one Venture Capital fund (VentureEast) and one angel network (Hyderabad Angels) to almost six VC fund companies,” said Srinivas Kollipara, CEO, T-Hub.
Though Hyderabad was a late-mover compared to Bengaluru, New Delhi or Mumbai, that has not deterred the ecosystem from flourishing. The city is home to many innovative product and services startups and has been making its presence felt globally. One of T-Hub’s most successful startup Banyan Nation recently became the first Indian firm to win the Circular Economy Award at the WEF. Another startup Hug Innovations won the Mayor of London’s India Emerging 20 Award and the list is endless.
“We are proud to say that we are one of the first startups to join T-Hub. The biggest help the engine has provided us is brand building. From a company that makes an innovative product in Hyderabad, we have been able to put ourselves on the global map,” says Raj Neravati, founder, Hug Innovations, which has built a smartwatch that has both personal safety and fitness tracking.
For any startup that has been and/or which is part of T-Hub, one of the most defining factor is visibility and exposure. The events conducted by T-Hub have also helped entrepreneurs get an insight into different issues such as revenue, legal and many more.
“Visibility and exposure is high in T-Hub. We were able to meet many global personalities because of our association with the startup engine. Another advantage is the proximity to big institutions such as ISB, IIIT-Hyderabad and UoH,” said Sri Charan Lakkaraju, founder, Stumagz, a social networking platform for colleges.
While quantifiable help like networking, mentorship, investors is one part of the story, another part is the emotional help that T-Hub has been able to provide. “The journey of an entrepreneur is very lonely. But being part of an ecosystem like T-Hub provides us with support and also keeps us motivated as we are working with like-minded people in the same space,” says K K Jain, founder, AnyTimeLoan, which provides loans under 15 minutes and has partnered with YES Bank.

Hyderabad: One of the most awaited routes of the Hyderabad Metro Rail, Ameerpet-Hitec City, is likely to be its busiest one. Services on the route, on which Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited already launched trial runs and is gearing up for inspection and clearance by the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS), is expected to ease traffic congestion in the busy areas of Yousufguda, Jubilee Hills, Madhapur and Hitec City.
“After the launch of the Metro services on the route, there are possibilities of private cars and cabs ferrying employees on the IT corridor going off the road. This is because many employees will prefer to take the Metro rather than getting stuck in traffic,” a senior official from the Cyberabad Traffic Police said.
HMRL officials are expecting the route to witness heavy footfall like in the case of the Ameerpet-LB Nagar route. Recently, the overall Metro patronage crossed 30 million passengers cumulative milestone in 351 days (less than a year) and from 20 million to 30 million in just 71 days.
Sensing the demand for Metro in the IT corridor, the Metro officials are making all efforts to launch the service at the earliest. Trial runs were launched on the route on November 29 and all civil works are being expedited at the stations even while waiting for the mandatory CMRS inspection.
Various aspects — technical, security and amenities, among others — will be checked by the CMRS team before according clearance for the launch of commercial operations on the route. Since the train reversal facility beyond Hitec City station up to Hotel Trident will take a few more months, Metro officials decided to operate the services on the route in ‘twin single line method’.
Under this method, a double-line railway track functions as two separate single lines. Each railway line works as an independent single line and trains are operated in both up and down directions on the same line.

Hyderabad: A few students of Sri Chaitanya Residential Junior College, Nagole campus, allegedly hurt themselves by slashing their wrists after the management did not declare a holiday for the general elections scheduled for Friday.
The girl students alleged that the college management had not declared a holiday for Diwali festival too and they were not allowed for any sort of trips outside the campus either. An audio clip of a student pleading for a trip of at least one or two days went viral on social media on Thursday.
“While all colleges have holiday for general elections, our college has not given us the same. Even for Diwali, there was no holiday and students are not allowed to go for any outings. It’s torturous for us and some students have cut their hands in protest. If the management does not heed, the consequences will be serious,” a student was heard saying in the audio clip.
Balala Hakkula Sangham president Achyuta Rao said corporate colleges were behaving inhumanly towards children without any sympathy, which may drive them to suicide.
Students complained to the Sangham saying that they were not allowed to even to attend to nature calls or to go to their room even if they were not well, he said, adding that the Sangham has approached the Rachakonda Police and that a thorough enquiry would be conducted.

Hyderabad: The Telangana Information Technology Association (TITA), which launched ‘Ungli Challenge’ on Nov 21 aimed at promoting the right to vote, will be announcing its winners. Each of the ten winners will get a cash prize of Rs 5,000.
As a part of the challenge, participants were to dance as per the pre-set choreography highlighting the importance of voting. These performances had to be posted on social media, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, by using the #UngliChallenge along with messages.

With the recent dissolution of the legislative assembly of Telangana about eight months before the end of the term, the state is likely to witness elections near the end of 2018. In order to vote in the elections, every citizen needs to be enrolled in the state voter list and needs to have a voter ID. It has become really easy now to enroll in the voter list, as it can be done with a few clicks online.
Here’s how you can enrol your name on the voter list:
Visit the website of the Chief Electoral Officer , Telangana and click on the ‘E-registration’ tab on the top of the homepage.
Select the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab from the drop down menu and choose the ‘ Form 6 ’ from the options given there.
In the form, select the option ‘As a first time voter’.
Accurately fill the form with the required personal details, like name, address, date of birth, etc.
Upload scanned copies of the required documents for proof of address and age, along with a photograph of the applicant.
Click submit.
The applicant will then receive an application reference number that serves as a receipt as well as a tracking number.
After the application is processed, a Booth Level Officer will visit to verify the details.
Upon successful verification, the voter ID card will be sent by post to the address that has been mentioned.
Important pointers for voters:
If the individual is a citizen of Telangana and already has a voter ID card but it is from a place other than Telangana and he/she has moved back to the state; enrolling in the voter list here is simple. It’s the same as above but instead of selecting the ‘As a first time voter’, select the ‘due to shifting from another constituency’.
On the same website, the ‘ Form 8 ’ under the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab can be used for corrections in the voter ID. If there is a correction in the name, date of birth, address, etc, the Form 8 can be filled with the necessary details and the voter ID will be corrected.
If any individual has shifted their residence within the same constituency, then ‘ Form 8A ’ can be used to transfer their name to a relevant part of the voter roll in the same constituency.
The status of one’s application can be checked under the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab by clicking on ‘Know Your Status’.

Some age-by-age ideas to keep your little one engaged

Kids are a blessing in disguise, even if they are your kids or somebody else’s, their growth spurt from a newborn to a toddler can be very quick. But, it is also a slow learning process for the kid and the parent. During this time, anything and everything will be very amusing. So, here are a few tips to keep them entertaining.
Infants (age 0)
These precious little beings are very easy to entertain in this period of their lives, by rocking them when they sleep and oh-so-gently stretching them and humming to them.
Toddlers (age 0-3)
For this age group, you have to step up your game as they are developing and tend to imitate what the adults are doing. In this tender age, you can start stimulating their senses by sensory play that includes activities which stimulates young child’s senses — touch, smell, taste, sight, and hearing.
Kids (age 3-9)
This is where a preschool baby is growing into a curious being and is old enough to have a little bit of attention span. Kids at this age are very outgoing and active. Storytelling, mind exercises and introducing them to a sport can do the trick.
Adolescents (age 10-up)
A turning point for the kids as they slowly hit puberty and have a mind of their own. They tend to be less dependent on the parent and have their own ideas to entrain themselves, for example, having a collection of books to read, having a sport to play. However, they need guidance of the parent to move forward.
It’s hard to draw firm boundaries on what’s age appropriate. So, don’t feel like it’s weird to propose one of the little-kid activities to a bigger kid, or vice versa; just adapt it to their interest and skill level as needed.

For some inexplicable reasons, this well-intentioned outing does not take off. The story line of a romance suffering a communal divide refuses to infuse passion or interest. Paradoxically it comes from the man who gave us Kai Po Che.
The film is meandering and tiresome. No, it is not so much the predictable rich poor, Hindu Muslim divide. It is that the script simply refuses to deal with any drama and the resultant end product is a drab fare. It is a tale that seeks to tell romance, fails then moves on to depict a tragedy and tires too soon.
Mansoor (Sushant Singh Rajput)is a Pithoo (a human porter) who carries people up the hilly Kedarnath. He runs into a feisty Mukku (Sara Ali Khan) who is the daughter of the local tradition filled Pandit Brijlal (a faded Nithish Bhradwaj). Her Mom (Sonali Sachdev) and sister Brinda(Pooja Gor) are in contrast, very traditional. They find her ways too shocking for the traditional family and the holy town. Mukku and Mansoor have all the time and the picturesque locales to fall in love unmindful of the tremors in store- particularly from Kullu (Nishant Dahiya- stiff as a stick). The expected rough weather unleashes after the tame love story just reaches the take off stage. Even as Kullu carries out his threats to wed Mukku and evict the entire community, the 2013 Uttarakhand tragedy takes over.
The narrative is clearly dilinated into two tales: the love story and the natural calamity. Tangential reference to environmental concerns is half hearted and in poor measure. Three prospective areas of drama : the class-communal clash, the threat of big business trying to push out the local players and the larger issue of environment all and each of which could have the central piece of the drama fail to materialize. Even the love story is a non starter with the audience loosing their patience and waiting for the lead pair to fall in love and romance in Kedarnath.
The crew fails the film. Kanika Dhillon who is incharge of scripting her story and giving it a screen appearance fails to infuse any interest in the film. For a romance and the launch of a young actress the music by Hitesh Sonik is hardly worth remembering. It is the cinematography by Tushar Kanti Ray that redeems the film to a degree. Amazing stuff. He ensures that the backdrop of the amazing Kedarnath is not lost and the actors still have their space before the lense.
While the cast is adequate, one would have expected the veteran support cast to do better. For instance Pooja Gor is at best alright. Alka Amin does her best when called upon. Sushant is not called upon to do anything different. Yet the task is translated with endearing sincerity and a sure sense of timing. He ensures that he does not steal screen space from the debutant. Sara is a clear reminder of Mom Amrita who started off with a very similar role in Betab. There is promise as there is room for cleaning up the act. A sure welcome add to cinema.
Like another young couple debut love story of recent times this too is a tale of an opportunity going abegging.

Hyderabad: One of the most awaited routes of the Hyderabad Metro Rail, Ameerpet-Hitec City, is likely to be its busiest one. Services on the route, on which Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited already launched trial runs and is gearing up for inspection and clearance by the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS), is expected to ease traffic congestion in the busy areas of Yousufguda, Jubilee Hills, Madhapur and Hitec City.
“After the launch of the Metro services on the route, there are possibilities of private cars and cabs ferrying employees on the IT corridor going off the road. This is because many employees will prefer to take the Metro rather than getting stuck in traffic,” a senior official from the Cyberabad Traffic Police said.
HMRL officials are expecting the route to witness heavy footfall like in the case of the Ameerpet-LB Nagar route. Recently, the overall Metro patronage crossed 30 million passengers cumulative milestone in 351 days (less than a year) and from 20 million to 30 million in just 71 days.
Sensing the demand for Metro in the IT corridor, the Metro officials are making all efforts to launch the service at the earliest. Trial runs were launched on the route on November 29 and all civil works are being expedited at the stations even while waiting for the mandatory CMRS inspection.
Various aspects — technical, security and amenities, among others — will be checked by the CMRS team before according clearance for the launch of commercial operations on the route. Since the train reversal facility beyond Hitec City station up to Hotel Trident will take a few more months, Metro officials decided to operate the services on the route in ‘twin single line method’.
Under this method, a double-line railway track functions as two separate single lines. Each railway line works as an independent single line and trains are operated in both up and down directions on the same line.

Metro rail works at Madhapur — Photo: Hrudayanand
Hyderabad: One of the most awaited routes of the Hyderabad Metro Rail, Ameerpet-Hitec City, is likely to be its busiest one. Services on the route, on which Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited already launched trial runs and is gearing up for inspection and clearance by the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS), is expected to ease traffic congestion in the busy areas of Yousufguda, Jubilee Hills, Madhapur and Hitec City.
“After the launch of the Metro services on the route, there are possibilities of private cars and cabs ferrying employees on the IT corridor going off the road. This is because many employees will prefer to take the Metro rather than getting stuck in traffic,” a senior official from the Cyberabad Traffic Police said.
HMRL officials are expecting the route to witness heavy footfall like in the case of the Ameerpet-LB Nagar route. Recently, the overall Metro patronage crossed 30 million passengers cumulative milestone in 351 days (less than a year) and from 20 million to 30 million in just 71 days.
Sensing the demand for Metro in the IT corridor, the Metro officials are making all efforts to launch the service at the earliest. Trial runs were launched on the route on November 29 and all civil works are being expedited at the stations even while waiting for the mandatory CMRS inspection.
Various aspects — technical, security and amenities, among others — will be checked by the CMRS team before according clearance for the launch of commercial operations on the route. Since the train reversal facility beyond Hitec City station up to Hotel Trident will take a few more months, Metro officials decided to operate the services on the route in ‘twin single line method’.
Under this method, a double-line railway track functions as two separate single lines. Each railway line works as an independent single line and trains are operated in both up and down directions on the same line.

Is your makeup product genuine?
Whatever be the brand, finding the authentic beauty product is a real deal

As shoppers are fuelled by the desire to emulate their Instagram idols, most times they end up buying fake versions of the most popular makeup brands at a fraction of the price. But, while these cheap imitations may look like the real deal, hidden inside are a cocktail of possibly damaging components which can lead to terrible health consequences. So, bargain hunters, beware of the cheap designer cosmetics that you’re attempting to buy; they could be toxic too.
It might surprise you that even large stores sometimes sell knock-off products. So, to avoid such unpleasant surprises, do not hesitate to visit manufacturer’s website and check the list of retailers to buy authentic products. Fortunately, sometimes, official retailers also sell their cosmetics at discounted prices.
However, extremely high discounts could be signs that the makeup items are fakes. Eighty per cent of the reports say that authentic beauty products can’t be sold at a discount. So, before you make a purchase, ask an assistant to show their quality certificate, and if they refuse to show, it’s simple — just skip the store. However, to avoid such scams, follow these simple tips that will help you keep your cosmetics collection free of fake products.
Cosmetic testers
Don’t hesitate to try the cosmetic testers in the stores. Remember the high-quality eye shadows and blushes should not smear or slide off during the day, a genuine lipstick should always apply smoothly and evenly, and the authentic designer mascara will never crumble.
The right product
Even if the packaging of a counterfeit product looks very similar to the real thing, you can probably spot a knock-off by inspecting the brushes and sponges. They may differ in size, shape, or colour, and the overall quality of them may be not satisfactory.
Shades of cosmetics
Fake eye shadows, blushes, lipsticks, and powders are often produced in shades that are not used in authentic products. To avoid buying a fake, visit the manufacturer’s website to see which colours of each makeup product are real.
Make up brushes
All makeup brushes have their own signature designs and features, which will be easy to identify on original product. Also the bristles of real brushes are dense and quite strong, and would not fall out if pulled out.

Some age-by-age ideas to keep your little one engaged

Kids are a blessing in disguise, even if they are your kids or somebody else’s, their growth spurt from a newborn to a toddler can be very quick. But, it is also a slow learning process for the kid and the parent. During this time, anything and everything will be very amusing. So, here are a few tips to keep them entertaining.
Infants (age 0)
These precious little beings are very easy to entertain in this period of their lives, by rocking them when they sleep and oh-so-gently stretching them and humming to them.
Toddlers (age 0-3)
For this age group, you have to step up your game as they are developing and tend to imitate what the adults are doing. In this tender age, you can start stimulating their senses by sensory play that includes activities which stimulates young child’s senses — touch, smell, taste, sight, and hearing.
Kids (age 3-9)
This is where a preschool baby is growing into a curious being and is old enough to have a little bit of attention span. Kids at this age are very outgoing and active. Storytelling, mind exercises and introducing them to a sport can do the trick.
Adolescents (age 10-up)
A turning point for the kids as they slowly hit puberty and have a mind of their own. They tend to be less dependent on the parent and have their own ideas to entrain themselves, for example, having a collection of books to read, having a sport to play. However, they need guidance of the parent to move forward.
It’s hard to draw firm boundaries on what’s age appropriate. So, don’t feel like it’s weird to propose one of the little-kid activities to a bigger kid, or vice versa; just adapt it to their interest and skill level as needed.

For some inexplicable reasons, this well-intentioned outing does not take off. The story line of a romance suffering a communal divide refuses to infuse passion or interest. Paradoxically it comes from the man who gave us Kai Po Che.
The film is meandering and tiresome. No, it is not so much the predictable rich poor, Hindu Muslim divide. It is that the script simply refuses to deal with any drama and the resultant end product is a drab fare. It is a tale that seeks to tell romance, fails then moves on to depict a tragedy and tires too soon.
Mansoor (Sushant Singh Rajput)is a Pithoo (a human porter) who carries people up the hilly Kedarnath. He runs into a feisty Mukku (Sara Ali Khan) who is the daughter of the local tradition filled Pandit Brijlal (a faded Nithish Bhradwaj). Her Mom (Sonali Sachdev) and sister Brinda(Pooja Gor) are in contrast, very traditional. They find her ways too shocking for the traditional family and the holy town. Mukku and Mansoor have all the time and the picturesque locales to fall in love unmindful of the tremors in store- particularly from Kullu (Nishant Dahiya- stiff as a stick). The expected rough weather unleashes after the tame love story just reaches the take off stage. Even as Kullu carries out his threats to wed Mukku and evict the entire community, the 2013 Uttarakhand tragedy takes over.
The narrative is clearly dilinated into two tales: the love story and the natural calamity. Tangential reference to environmental concerns is half hearted and in poor measure. Three prospective areas of drama : the class-communal clash, the threat of big business trying to push out the local players and the larger issue of environment all and each of which could have the central piece of the drama fail to materialize. Even the love story is a non starter with the audience loosing their patience and waiting for the lead pair to fall in love and romance in Kedarnath.
The crew fails the film. Kanika Dhillon who is incharge of scripting her story and giving it a screen appearance fails to infuse any interest in the film. For a romance and the launch of a young actress the music by Hitesh Sonik is hardly worth remembering. It is the cinematography by Tushar Kanti Ray that redeems the film to a degree. Amazing stuff. He ensures that the backdrop of the amazing Kedarnath is not lost and the actors still have their space before the lense.
While the cast is adequate, one would have expected the veteran support cast to do better. For instance Pooja Gor is at best alright. Alka Amin does her best when called upon. Sushant is not called upon to do anything different. Yet the task is translated with endearing sincerity and a sure sense of timing. He ensures that he does not steal screen space from the debutant. Sara is a clear reminder of Mom Amrita who started off with a very similar role in Betab. There is promise as there is room for cleaning up the act. A sure welcome add to cinema.
Like another young couple debut love story of recent times this too is a tale of an opportunity going abegging.

Hyderabad: One of the most awaited routes of the Hyderabad Metro Rail, Ameerpet-Hitec City, is likely to be its busiest one. Services on the route, on which Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited already launched trial runs and is gearing up for inspection and clearance by the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS), is expected to ease traffic congestion in the busy areas of Yousufguda, Jubilee Hills, Madhapur and Hitec City.
“After the launch of the Metro services on the route, there are possibilities of private cars and cabs ferrying employees on the IT corridor going off the road. This is because many employees will prefer to take the Metro rather than getting stuck in traffic,” a senior official from the Cyberabad Traffic Police said.
HMRL officials are expecting the route to witness heavy footfall like in the case of the Ameerpet-LB Nagar route. Recently, the overall Metro patronage crossed 30 million passengers cumulative milestone in 351 days (less than a year) and from 20 million to 30 million in just 71 days.
Sensing the demand for Metro in the IT corridor, the Metro officials are making all efforts to launch the service at the earliest. Trial runs were launched on the route on November 29 and all civil works are being expedited at the stations even while waiting for the mandatory CMRS inspection.
Various aspects — technical, security and amenities, among others — will be checked by the CMRS team before according clearance for the launch of commercial operations on the route. Since the train reversal facility beyond Hitec City station up to Hotel Trident will take a few more months, Metro officials decided to operate the services on the route in ‘twin single line method’.
Under this method, a double-line railway track functions as two separate single lines. Each railway line works as an independent single line and trains are operated in both up and down directions on the same line.

With the recent dissolution of the legislative assembly of Telangana about eight months before the end of the term, the state is likely to witness elections near the end of 2018. In order to vote in the elections, every citizen needs to be enrolled in the state voter list and needs to have a voter ID. It has become really easy now to enroll in the voter list, as it can be done with a few clicks online.
Here’s how you can enrol your name on the voter list:
Visit the website of the Chief Electoral Officer , Telangana and click on the ‘E-registration’ tab on the top of the homepage.
Select the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab from the drop down menu and choose the ‘ Form 6 ’ from the options given there.
In the form, select the option ‘As a first time voter’.
Accurately fill the form with the required personal details, like name, address, date of birth, etc.
Upload scanned copies of the required documents for proof of address and age, along with a photograph of the applicant.
Click submit.
The applicant will then receive an application reference number that serves as a receipt as well as a tracking number.
After the application is processed, a Booth Level Officer will visit to verify the details.
Upon successful verification, the voter ID card will be sent by post to the address that has been mentioned.
Important pointers for voters:
If the individual is a citizen of Telangana and already has a voter ID card but it is from a place other than Telangana and he/she has moved back to the state; enrolling in the voter list here is simple. It’s the same as above but instead of selecting the ‘As a first time voter’, select the ‘due to shifting from another constituency’.
On the same website, the ‘ Form 8 ’ under the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab can be used for corrections in the voter ID. If there is a correction in the name, date of birth, address, etc, the Form 8 can be filled with the necessary details and the voter ID will be corrected.
If any individual has shifted their residence within the same constituency, then ‘ Form 8A ’ can be used to transfer their name to a relevant part of the voter roll in the same constituency.
The status of one’s application can be checked under the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab by clicking on ‘Know Your Status’.

Kids are a blessing in disguise, even if they are your kids or somebody else’s, their growth spurt from a newborn to a toddler can be very quick. But, it is also a slow learning process for the kid and the parent. During this time, anything and everything will be very amusing. So, here are a few tips to keep them entertaining.
Infants (age 0)
These precious little beings are very easy to entertain in this period of their lives, by rocking them when they sleep and oh-so-gently stretching them and humming to them.
Toddlers (age 0-3)
For this age group, you have to step up your game as they are developing and tend to imitate what the adults are doing. In this tender age, you can start stimulating their senses by sensory play that includes activities which stimulates young child’s senses — touch, smell, taste, sight, and hearing.
Kids (age 3-9)
This is where a preschool baby is growing into a curious being and is old enough to have a little bit of attention span. Kids at this age are very outgoing and active. Storytelling, mind exercises and introducing them to a sport can do the trick.
Adolescents (age 10-up)
A turning point for the kids as they slowly hit puberty and have a mind of their own. They tend to be less dependent on the parent and have their own ideas to entrain themselves, for example, having a collection of books to read, having a sport to play. However, they need guidance of the parent to move forward.
It’s hard to draw firm boundaries on what’s age appropriate. So, don’t feel like it’s weird to propose one of the little-kid activities to a bigger kid, or vice versa; just adapt it to their interest and skill level as needed.

Kedarnath: Like any other love story gone abegging
The film is meandering and tiresome. No, it is not so much the predictable rich poor, Hindu Muslim divide.

For some inexplicable reasons, this well-intentioned outing does not take off. The story line of a romance suffering a communal divide refuses to infuse passion or interest. Paradoxically it comes from the man who gave us Kai Po Che.
The film is meandering and tiresome. No, it is not so much the predictable rich poor, Hindu Muslim divide. It is that the script simply refuses to deal with any drama and the resultant end product is a drab fare. It is a tale that seeks to tell romance, fails then moves on to depict a tragedy and tires too soon.
Mansoor (Sushant Singh Rajput)is a Pithoo (a human porter) who carries people up the hilly Kedarnath. He runs into a feisty Mukku (Sara Ali Khan) who is the daughter of the local tradition filled Pandit Brijlal (a faded Nithish Bhradwaj). Her Mom (Sonali Sachdev) and sister Brinda(Pooja Gor) are in contrast, very traditional. They find her ways too shocking for the traditional family and the holy town. Mukku and Mansoor have all the time and the picturesque locales to fall in love unmindful of the tremors in store- particularly from Kullu (Nishant Dahiya- stiff as a stick). The expected rough weather unleashes after the tame love story just reaches the take off stage. Even as Kullu carries out his threats to wed Mukku and evict the entire community, the 2013 Uttarakhand tragedy takes over.
The narrative is clearly dilinated into two tales: the love story and the natural calamity. Tangential reference to environmental concerns is half hearted and in poor measure. Three prospective areas of drama : the class-communal clash, the threat of big business trying to push out the local players and the larger issue of environment all and each of which could have the central piece of the drama fail to materialize. Even the love story is a non starter with the audience loosing their patience and waiting for the lead pair to fall in love and romance in Kedarnath.
The crew fails the film. Kanika Dhillon who is incharge of scripting her story and giving it a screen appearance fails to infuse any interest in the film. For a romance and the launch of a young actress the music by Hitesh Sonik is hardly worth remembering. It is the cinematography by Tushar Kanti Ray that redeems the film to a degree. Amazing stuff. He ensures that the backdrop of the amazing Kedarnath is not lost and the actors still have their space before the lense.
While the cast is adequate, one would have expected the veteran support cast to do better. For instance Pooja Gor is at best alright. Alka Amin does her best when called upon. Sushant is not called upon to do anything different. Yet the task is translated with endearing sincerity and a sure sense of timing. He ensures that he does not steal screen space from the debutant. Sara is a clear reminder of Mom Amrita who started off with a very similar role in Betab. There is promise as there is room for cleaning up the act. A sure welcome add to cinema.
Like another young couple debut love story of recent times this too is a tale of an opportunity going abegging.

Krishnamurthy Subramanian
Hyderabad: The government on Friday appointed ISB Hyderabad Associate Professor of Finance (with tenure) and executive director for the Centre for Analytical Finance Krishnamurthy Subramanian as chief economic adviser (CEA) for a period of three years. The post of CEA had been lying vacant since Arvind Subramanaian left the Finance ministry after a four-year stint in July this year.
“The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) has approved for the appointment of Dr Krishnamurthy Subramanian, Associate Professor and ED (CAF), ISB, Hyderabad, to the post of Chief Economic Adviser,” said a government notification.
Subramanian is Ph D (Financial Economics) from Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, and did his MBA (Finance) from Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta and B Tech (Electrical Engineering) from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur. He is one of the world’s leading experts in banking, corporate governance and economic policy. He taught at ISB- Corporate Control, Mergers and Acquisitions, and Investment Analysis.
His services on the expert committees on Corporate Governance for the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and on Governance of Banks for The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have established him as one of the chief architects of corporate governance and banking reforms in India. He served as a member of SEBI’s Standing Committees on Alternative Investment Policy, Primary Markets, Secondary Markets and Research. As part of his corporate policy work, he serves on the boards of Bandhan Bank, the National Institute of Bank Management, and the RBI Academy.
His research in banking, law and finance, innovation and economic growth, and corporate governance has been published in the world’s leading journals, including The Review of Financial Studies, the Journal of Financial Economics, the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, and the Journal of Law and Economics.
Before beginning his academic career, Subramanian worked as a consultant with JPMorgan Chase in New York. He also served in a management role in the elite derivatives research group at ICICI.
Because of his work in shaping the Indian banking sector and other path-breaking research with a significant societal impact, Subramanian was named ISB’s inaugural Alumni Endowment Research Fellow in 2014.
Even while still earning his MBA and PhD, he produced award-winning work. Subramanian’s PhD dissertation earned the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Dissertation Fellowship, which recognises the top 15 PhD dissertations across all disciplines every year. While earning his MBA at the Indian Institute of Management in Calcutta, he was named to the Honour Roll of the Institute for being a top ranker in the batch and was awarded the Institute’s coveted medal for the most balanced outlook to business problems. He holds a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur.
In previous academic roles, Subramanian served on the finance faculty at Goizueta Business School at Emory University in the United States. He obtained his MBA and PhD in Financial Economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business under the advice of Professor Luigi Zingales and Professor Raghuram Rajan.
His own students and research associates have gone on to join the world’s top PhD programmes, including Chicago Booth, MIT Sloan, Kellogg, Berkeley, London Business School, Duke and Emory universities.

Hyderabad: One of the most awaited routes of the Hyderabad Metro Rail, Ameerpet-Hitec City, is likely to be its busiest one. Services on the route, on which Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited already launched trial runs and is gearing up for inspection and clearance by the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS), is expected to ease traffic congestion in the busy areas of Yousufguda, Jubilee Hills, Madhapur and Hitec City.
“After the launch of the Metro services on the route, there are possibilities of private cars and cabs ferrying employees on the IT corridor going off the road. This is because many employees will prefer to take the Metro rather than getting stuck in traffic,” a senior official from the Cyberabad Traffic Police said.
HMRL officials are expecting the route to witness heavy footfall like in the case of the Ameerpet-LB Nagar route. Recently, the overall Metro patronage crossed 30 million passengers cumulative milestone in 351 days (less than a year) and from 20 million to 30 million in just 71 days.
Sensing the demand for Metro in the IT corridor, the Metro officials are making all efforts to launch the service at the earliest. Trial runs were launched on the route on November 29 and all civil works are being expedited at the stations even while waiting for the mandatory CMRS inspection.
Various aspects — technical, security and amenities, among others — will be checked by the CMRS team before according clearance for the launch of commercial operations on the route. Since the train reversal facility beyond Hitec City station up to Hotel Trident will take a few more months, Metro officials decided to operate the services on the route in ‘twin single line method’.
Under this method, a double-line railway track functions as two separate single lines. Each railway line works as an independent single line and trains are operated in both up and down directions on the same line.

With the recent dissolution of the legislative assembly of Telangana about eight months before the end of the term, the state is likely to witness elections near the end of 2018. In order to vote in the elections, every citizen needs to be enrolled in the state voter list and needs to have a voter ID. It has become really easy now to enroll in the voter list, as it can be done with a few clicks online.
Here’s how you can enrol your name on the voter list:
Visit the website of the Chief Electoral Officer , Telangana and click on the ‘E-registration’ tab on the top of the homepage.
Select the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab from the drop down menu and choose the ‘ Form 6 ’ from the options given there.
In the form, select the option ‘As a first time voter’.
Accurately fill the form with the required personal details, like name, address, date of birth, etc.
Upload scanned copies of the required documents for proof of address and age, along with a photograph of the applicant.
Click submit.
The applicant will then receive an application reference number that serves as a receipt as well as a tracking number.
After the application is processed, a Booth Level Officer will visit to verify the details.
Upon successful verification, the voter ID card will be sent by post to the address that has been mentioned.
Important pointers for voters:
If the individual is a citizen of Telangana and already has a voter ID card but it is from a place other than Telangana and he/she has moved back to the state; enrolling in the voter list here is simple. It’s the same as above but instead of selecting the ‘As a first time voter’, select the ‘due to shifting from another constituency’.
On the same website, the ‘ Form 8 ’ under the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab can be used for corrections in the voter ID. If there is a correction in the name, date of birth, address, etc, the Form 8 can be filled with the necessary details and the voter ID will be corrected.
If any individual has shifted their residence within the same constituency, then ‘ Form 8A ’ can be used to transfer their name to a relevant part of the voter roll in the same constituency.
The status of one’s application can be checked under the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab by clicking on ‘Know Your Status’.

From the very first scene itself, something seems off and unnatural. The film starts with Tammy (Tamannaah) and Sanju (Sundeep Kishan) conversing in a flirty and sassy way that’s seen a lot in the first-meeting scenes in many Hollywood films and this, coming from a Telugu film, seems very unnatural. This film like meeting an American NRI kid for the first time and being confused after seeing their foreign body language in an Indian body. The entire film is like that, it just doesn’t feel right.
The first scene also has the lead characters talking to each other about how ‘abbailu andaru inthe and ammailu andaru inthe’, and that’s just the beginning of gender stereotyping in this film.
Right after the first conversation between the two, the narrative jumps to six months down the line when the two are living together but evidently nothing happens between them and that results in their breakup. Tammy starts dating a much older divorcee Krish (Navdeep) who comes, has a few long drawn sleep inducing conversations with Tammy and then is dumped by her for reasons best known to him. Sanju tries his hand at an arranged marriage where tries being with the girl and eventually breaks up with her for a reason that is extremely cliched. Then there’s an interval bang that’s just a grasping-at-straws attempt at an interval bang.
It would have gone a long way if the film focused more on the development of characters instead of trying to emphasize and constantly reiterate on gender stereotypes. The storyline is very similar to Love Aaj Kal, in the sense that the lead pair meets, hits it off, dates, breaks up, tries other people and finally comes back to each other but lacks the characterisation that Love Aaj Kal has. Because of this, the crucial connect factor is lost, as the viewers don’t have anything they can relate to in this film. This genre worked to an extent in Bollywood with the likes of Imran Khan, Saif Ali Khan, etc, but the closest a Telugu film got to this genre is probably Orange.
As far as the performances go, Sarath Babu is the only person who can be credited with good performance in this film. Sundeep Kishan’s Sanju and Tamannaah’s Tammy are disappointing and it is surprising, especially Sundeep’s performance, considering how well he performed in his previous films. Their performances seem very exaggerated and caricatured. The narrative falls flat at many points and the songs popping up every few minutes again take the attention away.
The camera work is the only aspect of the film that feels professional, as it has pretty amazing shots. Manish Chandra has done a very commendable job with the camera.

Hyderabad: One of the most awaited routes of the Hyderabad Metro Rail, Ameerpet-Hitec City, is likely to be its busiest one. Services on the route, on which Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited already launched trial runs and is gearing up for inspection and clearance by the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS), is expected to ease traffic congestion in the busy areas of Yousufguda, Jubilee Hills, Madhapur and Hitec City.
“After the launch of the Metro services on the route, there are possibilities of private cars and cabs ferrying employees on the IT corridor going off the road. This is because many employees will prefer to take the Metro rather than getting stuck in traffic,” a senior official from the Cyberabad Traffic Police said.
HMRL officials are expecting the route to witness heavy footfall like in the case of the Ameerpet-LB Nagar route. Recently, the overall Metro patronage crossed 30 million passengers cumulative milestone in 351 days (less than a year) and from 20 million to 30 million in just 71 days.
Sensing the demand for Metro in the IT corridor, the Metro officials are making all efforts to launch the service at the earliest. Trial runs were launched on the route on November 29 and all civil works are being expedited at the stations even while waiting for the mandatory CMRS inspection.
Various aspects — technical, security and amenities, among others — will be checked by the CMRS team before according clearance for the launch of commercial operations on the route. Since the train reversal facility beyond Hitec City station up to Hotel Trident will take a few more months, Metro officials decided to operate the services on the route in ‘twin single line method’.
Under this method, a double-line railway track functions as two separate single lines. Each railway line works as an independent single line and trains are operated in both up and down directions on the same line.

With the recent dissolution of the legislative assembly of Telangana about eight months before the end of the term, the state is likely to witness elections near the end of 2018. In order to vote in the elections, every citizen needs to be enrolled in the state voter list and needs to have a voter ID. It has become really easy now to enroll in the voter list, as it can be done with a few clicks online.
Here’s how you can enrol your name on the voter list:
Visit the website of the Chief Electoral Officer , Telangana and click on the ‘E-registration’ tab on the top of the homepage.
Select the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab from the drop down menu and choose the ‘ Form 6 ’ from the options given there.
In the form, select the option ‘As a first time voter’.
Accurately fill the form with the required personal details, like name, address, date of birth, etc.
Upload scanned copies of the required documents for proof of address and age, along with a photograph of the applicant.
Click submit.
The applicant will then receive an application reference number that serves as a receipt as well as a tracking number.
After the application is processed, a Booth Level Officer will visit to verify the details.
Upon successful verification, the voter ID card will be sent by post to the address that has been mentioned.
Important pointers for voters:
If the individual is a citizen of Telangana and already has a voter ID card but it is from a place other than Telangana and he/she has moved back to the state; enrolling in the voter list here is simple. It’s the same as above but instead of selecting the ‘As a first time voter’, select the ‘due to shifting from another constituency’.
On the same website, the ‘ Form 8 ’ under the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab can be used for corrections in the voter ID. If there is a correction in the name, date of birth, address, etc, the Form 8 can be filled with the necessary details and the voter ID will be corrected.
If any individual has shifted their residence within the same constituency, then ‘ Form 8A ’ can be used to transfer their name to a relevant part of the voter roll in the same constituency.
The status of one’s application can be checked under the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab by clicking on ‘Know Your Status’.

File Photo: Himalay Agarwal scored an unbeaten half-century to help Hyderabad post 124 runs against Madhya Pradesh in the Group B Ranji Trophy match.
Hyderabad: Medium-pacer Avesh Khan (7 for 24) ripped through the Hyderabad batting to put Madhya Pradesh on top on the first day of the four-day Group ‘B’ Elite Ranji Trophy league match at Holkar Stadium in Indore on Thursday.
Put into bat, Hyderabad were all out for 124 in 35.3 overs. But for a fighting, unbeaten 76-ball 69 (8×4, 2×6) by Himalay Agarwal, Hyderabad would have been bundled out for much lesser total. MP, in reply, finished 168 for 1 in 46 overs at draw of stumps.
Hyderabad, who scored a ten-wicket win over Himachal Pradesh in their previous encounter, were in for shock as a fiery Khan spelt doom. Bowling with good pace and pitching the ball up, Khan had Hyderabad batsmen ducking for cover. Left-handed opener Tanmay Agarwal was the first to go in the second over as he was bowled by Khan. Tanay Thyagarajan, who was promoted, lasted 19 deliveries before he became Khan’s second victim.
Skipper Akshath Reddy batted gamely but K Rohit Rayudu continued his poor form with willow. The left-hander edged Khan to wicketkeeper Naman Ojha for four. But Hyderabad had further setback when their consistent batsman left-hander B Sandeep snicked Khan and it became 29 for 5 in 15 overs when skipper Reddy too returned to pavilion as he fell to Gourav Khan for 21.
Hyderabad slipped further as Kolla Sumanth and T Ravi Teja were back without opening their accounts. At lunch, Hyderabad were tottering at 83 for 8 in 29 overs. It was left to Himalay to take the fight into the enemy’s camp. The middle order batsman stood tall and went on to complete his well-deserved half-century off 71 balls. He shared 33 runs with Hasan. However, Venkatesh Iyer broke the eighth wicket partnership by sending back Hasan. In the end, Himalay was stranded as Ravi Kiran and Mudassar went cheaply.
MP openers Aryanman Virkan Birla and Ajay Rohere (81 batting) put on 68 for the opening wicket. Left-arm spinner Thyagarajan gave the first wicket for Hyderabad by castling Birla’s stumps. Hyderabad could not get further breakthrough as Rohera and Rajat Patidar (51 batting) batted sensibly to put the home in command.

From the very first scene itself, something seems off and unnatural. The film starts with Tammy (Tamannaah) and Sanju (Sundeep Kishan) conversing in a flirty and sassy way that’s seen a lot in the first-meeting scenes in many Hollywood films and this, coming from a Telugu film, seems very unnatural. This film like meeting an American NRI kid for the first time and being confused after seeing their foreign body language in an Indian body. The entire film is like that, it just doesn’t feel right.
The first scene also has the lead characters talking to each other about how ‘abbailu andaru inthe and ammailu andaru inthe’, and that’s just the beginning of gender stereotyping in this film.
Right after the first conversation between the two, the narrative jumps to six months down the line when the two are living together but evidently nothing happens between them and that results in their breakup. Tammy starts dating a much older divorcee Krish (Navdeep) who comes, has a few long drawn sleep inducing conversations with Tammy and then is dumped by her for reasons best known to him. Sanju tries his hand at an arranged marriage where tries being with the girl and eventually breaks up with her for a reason that is extremely cliched. Then there’s an interval bang that’s just a grasping-at-straws attempt at an interval bang.
It would have gone a long way if the film focused more on the development of characters instead of trying to emphasize and constantly reiterate on gender stereotypes. The storyline is very similar to Love Aaj Kal, in the sense that the lead pair meets, hits it off, dates, breaks up, tries other people and finally comes back to each other but lacks the characterisation that Love Aaj Kal has. Because of this, the crucial connect factor is lost, as the viewers don’t have anything they can relate to in this film. This genre worked to an extent in Bollywood with the likes of Imran Khan, Saif Ali Khan, etc, but the closest a Telugu film got to this genre is probably Orange.
As far as the performances go, Sarath Babu is the only person who can be credited with good performance in this film. Sundeep Kishan’s Sanju and Tamannaah’s Tammy are disappointing and it is surprising, especially Sundeep’s performance, considering how well he performed in his previous films. Their performances seem very exaggerated and caricatured. The narrative falls flat at many points and the songs popping up every few minutes again take the attention away.
The camera work is the only aspect of the film that feels professional, as it has pretty amazing shots. Manish Chandra has done a very commendable job with the camera.

The age-old games, when slightly modified, are sure to take the excitement of your party a notch higher

One is never too old for house parties with friends or cousins; just gather a bunch of your favourite people, sitting around your living room in PJs, with an endless supply of junk food and good music, it’s the best stress buster anyone can have.
“Spending quality time with your loved ones is a must, especially, with the kind of lifestyle we are living today,” says Mahati, a resident of Kachiguda. “That’s what my cousins and I do whenever we need a break or feel extremely stressed out. It gives us the strength we need to get back into our schedules again,” she adds.
Food, music and games top the list of things that come to our mind when we think of a fun night with friends and family at home. “My friends and I love to gossip and talk about all the fun things we used to do together. Walking down the memory lane is something we do every single time we meet,” says Varsha, a student.
Here’s a list of games that can make your quality time all the more interesting:
Guess the tune
This is one level up from the usual antakshari. Instead of singing the songs that start with the last letter of the previous one, this game requires the participants to listen to the instrumentals or music and guess the song. Obviously, the team that guesses it right within the set time limit of 60 seconds bags the points.
Reverse charades
As the name suggests, the rules of the original game of charades are reversed here. Instead of one person enacting the word, movie or personality, in this version of charades, the team has to pick one person, ‘the guesser’, who will identify the answer, while the rest of the team enact it, all together. Time limit of 2 minutes is given, after which the clues will be passed on to the next team. This game is a lot more fun when played in multiple groups, each having not more than 4 players.
Pudding Pictionary
Gather a chocolate pudding, or rather a large jar of Nutella, butter paper and two drawing boards and you’re all set to play this game. The same rules of the usual Pictionary apply here as well, the only difference between these two versions of Pictionary is that, butter paper replaces white paper and fingers and Nutella take the place of pencils. Simply put, the players dip their fingers in chocolate pudding or Nutella and draw on the butter paper, while the rest of their teams try and guess the answer. The messier the game is, the more fun it is to play.

Hyderabad: Various exit polls have predicted a victory for Telangana Rashtra Samiti in the elections to the State Legislative Assembly, polling for which was held on Friday.
Cutting across networks, national news channels have painted a rosy picture for the TRS leaving the challenger, the Congress led Praja Kutami way behind in the projected winnings.
India Today TV, predicted a huge win for the TRS saying it expects the ruling party to be victorious in 79 to 91 seats with Congress plus allies getting 21 to 33 seats. BJP, it said is expected to win between one and three seats while ‘others’ will win between four and seven seats.
An Axis poll, telecast by different channels said TRS will romp home with 85 seats with Congress and its allies coming up with a mere 27. It too, like the India Today TV, predicted a near doom for BJP saying the party at power in the Centre, will win just two seats while ‘others’ will win five.The Times Now-CNX exit poll gave TRS 66 seats with Congress and its allies coming a distant second with 37 seats. It said the BJP will win seven seats while ‘others’ which presumably includes the AIMIM, are expected to take home nine seats.
Republic TV and CNN-News18 projected that TRS will win between 50 and 65 seats while giving Praja Kutami between 38 and 52 seats followed by 10 to 17 for ‘others’ and four to seven for the BJP.
Finally, a poll by NewsX predicted a closer contest between the two primary rivals saying the TRS is expected to win 57 seats with Congress following it with forty six. While ‘others’ are expected to win 10 seats, the BJP, it said, will win six seats.

Volunteers of an NGO and polling staff bring an elderly woman in a wheel-chair to polling station in Mancherial on Friday
Adialabad: Barring sporadic incidents of technical glitches in EVMs, missing names in the electoral rolls and non-distribution of poll slips, elections to the Telangana Legislative Assembly went off peacefully in four districts on Friday. Braving chilly weather conditions in several parts of the erstwhile Adilabad district, electors from all walks of life took part in the voting. However, the overall voting percentage dropped when compared to 2014.
Following cold wave conditions, the pattern of voting was sluggish in the initial stage between 7 am to 9 am. However, it gained momentum from 10 am. It reached over 60 percent in Mancherial, Kumram Bheem Asifabad and Nirmal districts except for Adilabad which saw 55.93 per cent by 3 pm. Polling concluded in Sirpur Chennur, Adilabad, Mancherial and Bellampalli Assembly segments at 4 pm as these places are affected by left-wing extremism.
Despite a slew of measures to create awareness over the need to utilise Right to Vote, the four districts saw a decline in the polling percentage. For instance, Adilabad and Mancherial stood in the bottom, while Kumram Bheem Asifabad and Nirmal managed to reach 70 per cent polling. Disinterest among electors, non-availability of poll slips and removal of names from voters list can also be attributed to the dip in polling percentage.
Forest Minister Jogu Ramanna cast his vote at his native place Deepaiguda in Jainath mandal at 7 am and his counterpart A Indrakaran Reddy exercised his franchise at Yellapalli village in Nirmal Rural mandal. Mancherial TRS candidate N Diwakar Rao and Sirpur (T) nominee K Konappa utilised their right to vote in a polling centre at RBHV of the town and at a private school in Kaghaznagar, respectively.
A handful of persons staged dharna in protest of their missing names from the electoral rolls, in Adilabad I town. They withdrew their agitation when returning officer of Adilabad Assembly constituency assured them justice.
Electronic voting machines were not turned on due to some technical glitches, causing inconvenience to electors in a few polling stations at Jannaram and Mancherial, for a brief period.
Activists of TRS and Congress exchanged heated arguments when the members of the latter were distributing poll slips downloaded from internet at polling station number 215 in Naspur mandal. Cops swung into action and recovered a computer and dummy EVM from the spot. Followers of TRS were detained for allegedly canvassing on the premises of a polling station in Mancherial town.

File Photo: Himalay Agarwal scored an unbeaten half-century to help Hyderabad post 124 runs against Madhya Pradesh in the Group B Ranji Trophy match.
Hyderabad: Medium-pacer Avesh Khan (7 for 24) ripped through the Hyderabad batting to put Madhya Pradesh on top on the first day of the four-day Group ‘B’ Elite Ranji Trophy league match at Holkar Stadium in Indore on Thursday.
Put into bat, Hyderabad were all out for 124 in 35.3 overs. But for a fighting, unbeaten 76-ball 69 (8×4, 2×6) by Himalay Agarwal, Hyderabad would have been bundled out for much lesser total. MP, in reply, finished 168 for 1 in 46 overs at draw of stumps.
Hyderabad, who scored a ten-wicket win over Himachal Pradesh in their previous encounter, were in for shock as a fiery Khan spelt doom. Bowling with good pace and pitching the ball up, Khan had Hyderabad batsmen ducking for cover. Left-handed opener Tanmay Agarwal was the first to go in the second over as he was bowled by Khan. Tanay Thyagarajan, who was promoted, lasted 19 deliveries before he became Khan’s second victim.
Skipper Akshath Reddy batted gamely but K Rohit Rayudu continued his poor form with willow. The left-hander edged Khan to wicketkeeper Naman Ojha for four. But Hyderabad had further setback when their consistent batsman left-hander B Sandeep snicked Khan and it became 29 for 5 in 15 overs when skipper Reddy too returned to pavilion as he fell to Gourav Khan for 21.
Hyderabad slipped further as Kolla Sumanth and T Ravi Teja were back without opening their accounts. At lunch, Hyderabad were tottering at 83 for 8 in 29 overs. It was left to Himalay to take the fight into the enemy’s camp. The middle order batsman stood tall and went on to complete his well-deserved half-century off 71 balls. He shared 33 runs with Hasan. However, Venkatesh Iyer broke the eighth wicket partnership by sending back Hasan. In the end, Himalay was stranded as Ravi Kiran and Mudassar went cheaply.
MP openers Aryanman Virkan Birla and Ajay Rohere (81 batting) put on 68 for the opening wicket. Left-arm spinner Thyagarajan gave the first wicket for Hyderabad by castling Birla’s stumps. Hyderabad could not get further breakthrough as Rohera and Rajat Patidar (51 batting) batted sensibly to put the home in command.

Hyderabad: One of the most awaited routes of the Hyderabad Metro Rail, Ameerpet-Hitec City, is likely to be its busiest one. Services on the route, on which Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited already launched trial runs and is gearing up for inspection and clearance by the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS), is expected to ease traffic congestion in the busy areas of Yousufguda, Jubilee Hills, Madhapur and Hitec City.
“After the launch of the Metro services on the route, there are possibilities of private cars and cabs ferrying employees on the IT corridor going off the road. This is because many employees will prefer to take the Metro rather than getting stuck in traffic,” a senior official from the Cyberabad Traffic Police said.
HMRL officials are expecting the route to witness heavy footfall like in the case of the Ameerpet-LB Nagar route. Recently, the overall Metro patronage crossed 30 million passengers cumulative milestone in 351 days (less than a year) and from 20 million to 30 million in just 71 days.
Sensing the demand for Metro in the IT corridor, the Metro officials are making all efforts to launch the service at the earliest. Trial runs were launched on the route on November 29 and all civil works are being expedited at the stations even while waiting for the mandatory CMRS inspection.
Various aspects — technical, security and amenities, among others — will be checked by the CMRS team before according clearance for the launch of commercial operations on the route. Since the train reversal facility beyond Hitec City station up to Hotel Trident will take a few more months, Metro officials decided to operate the services on the route in ‘twin single line method’.
Under this method, a double-line railway track functions as two separate single lines. Each railway line works as an independent single line and trains are operated in both up and down directions on the same line.

With the recent dissolution of the legislative assembly of Telangana about eight months before the end of the term, the state is likely to witness elections near the end of 2018. In order to vote in the elections, every citizen needs to be enrolled in the state voter list and needs to have a voter ID. It has become really easy now to enroll in the voter list, as it can be done with a few clicks online.
Here’s how you can enrol your name on the voter list:
Visit the website of the Chief Electoral Officer , Telangana and click on the ‘E-registration’ tab on the top of the homepage.
Select the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab from the drop down menu and choose the ‘ Form 6 ’ from the options given there.
In the form, select the option ‘As a first time voter’.
Accurately fill the form with the required personal details, like name, address, date of birth, etc.
Upload scanned copies of the required documents for proof of address and age, along with a photograph of the applicant.
Click submit.
The applicant will then receive an application reference number that serves as a receipt as well as a tracking number.
After the application is processed, a Booth Level Officer will visit to verify the details.
Upon successful verification, the voter ID card will be sent by post to the address that has been mentioned.
Important pointers for voters:
If the individual is a citizen of Telangana and already has a voter ID card but it is from a place other than Telangana and he/she has moved back to the state; enrolling in the voter list here is simple. It’s the same as above but instead of selecting the ‘As a first time voter’, select the ‘due to shifting from another constituency’.
On the same website, the ‘ Form 8 ’ under the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab can be used for corrections in the voter ID. If there is a correction in the name, date of birth, address, etc, the Form 8 can be filled with the necessary details and the voter ID will be corrected.
If any individual has shifted their residence within the same constituency, then ‘ Form 8A ’ can be used to transfer their name to a relevant part of the voter roll in the same constituency.

T-Hub, over the last three years been able to provide the required support to startups through its ecosystem

Hyderabad: One of the biggest help for any entrepreneur is the chance to network. And this is what IT Minister K T Rama Rao’s pet project T-Hub has been able to provide to emerging startups in Telangana.
The startup engine, a brainchild of Rama Rao, has over the last three years been able to provide all kinds of support to startups through its ecosystem, ranging from networking to mentoring and funding, apart from physical space and any other help that a startup would need.
With the dream of making Hyderabad a global city, the Minister along with representatives from academia and corporates set up the first building of T-Hub in November 2015. And over three years, T-Hub transformed itself into an ecosystem of its own. Modern infrastructure, global events and innovative startups form the basis of this ecosystem that is growing each day.
“When we were discussing the idea of T-Hub, we barely had 200 startups in Hyderabad. This has gone up to over 2,000 in just three years. Not only this, the whole ecosystem has changed from just one Venture Capital fund (VentureEast) and one angel network (Hyderabad Angels) to almost six VC fund companies,” said Srinivas Kollipara, CEO, T-Hub.
Though Hyderabad was a late-mover compared to Bengaluru, New Delhi or Mumbai, that has not deterred the ecosystem from flourishing. The city is home to many innovative product and services startups and has been making its presence felt globally. One of T-Hub’s most successful startup Banyan Nation recently became the first Indian firm to win the Circular Economy Award at the WEF. Another startup Hug Innovations won the Mayor of London’s India Emerging 20 Award and the list is endless.
“We are proud to say that we are one of the first startups to join T-Hub. The biggest help the engine has provided us is brand building. From a company that makes an innovative product in Hyderabad, we have been able to put ourselves on the global map,” says Raj Neravati, founder, Hug Innovations, which has built a smartwatch that has both personal safety and fitness tracking.
For any startup that has been and/or which is part of T-Hub, one of the most defining factor is visibility and exposure. The events conducted by T-Hub have also helped entrepreneurs get an insight into different issues such as revenue, legal and many more.
“Visibility and exposure is high in T-Hub. We were able to meet many global personalities because of our association with the startup engine. Another advantage is the proximity to big institutions such as ISB, IIIT-Hyderabad and UoH,” said Sri Charan Lakkaraju, founder, Stumagz, a social networking platform for colleges.
While quantifiable help like networking, mentorship, investors is one part of the story, another part is the emotional help that T-Hub has been able to provide. “The journey of an entrepreneur is very lonely. But being part of an ecosystem like T-Hub provides us with support and also keeps us motivated as we are working with like-minded people in the same space,” says K K Jain, founder, AnyTimeLoan, which provides loans under 15 minutes and has partnered with YES Bank.

Hyderabad: One of the most awaited routes of the Hyderabad Metro Rail, Ameerpet-Hitec City, is likely to be its busiest one. Services on the route, on which Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited already launched trial runs and is gearing up for inspection and clearance by the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS), is expected to ease traffic congestion in the busy areas of Yousufguda, Jubilee Hills, Madhapur and Hitec City.
“After the launch of the Metro services on the route, there are possibilities of private cars and cabs ferrying employees on the IT corridor going off the road. This is because many employees will prefer to take the Metro rather than getting stuck in traffic,” a senior official from the Cyberabad Traffic Police said.
HMRL officials are expecting the route to witness heavy footfall like in the case of the Ameerpet-LB Nagar route. Recently, the overall Metro patronage crossed 30 million passengers cumulative milestone in 351 days (less than a year) and from 20 million to 30 million in just 71 days.
Sensing the demand for Metro in the IT corridor, the Metro officials are making all efforts to launch the service at the earliest. Trial runs were launched on the route on November 29 and all civil works are being expedited at the stations even while waiting for the mandatory CMRS inspection.

Hyderabad: A few students of Sri Chaitanya Residential Junior College, Nagole campus, allegedly hurt themselves by slashing their wrists after the management did not declare a holiday for the general elections scheduled for Friday.
The girl students alleged that the college management had not declared a holiday for Diwali festival too and they were not allowed for any sort of trips outside the campus either. An audio clip of a student pleading for a trip of at least one or two days went viral on social media on Thursday.
“While all colleges have holiday for general elections, our college has not given us the same. Even for Diwali, there was no holiday and students are not allowed to go for any outings. It’s torturous for us and some students have cut their hands in protest. If the management does not heed, the consequences will be serious,” a student was heard saying in the audio clip.
Balala Hakkula Sangham president Achyuta Rao said corporate colleges were behaving inhumanly towards children without any sympathy, which may drive them to suicide.
Students complained to the Sangham saying that they were not allowed to even to attend to nature calls or to go to their room even if they were not well, he said, adding that the Sangham has approached the Rachakonda Police and that a thorough enquiry would be conducted.

With the recent dissolution of the legislative assembly of Telangana about eight months before the end of the term, the state is likely to witness elections near the end of 2018. In order to vote in the elections, every citizen needs to be enrolled in the state voter list and needs to have a voter ID. It has become really easy now to enroll in the voter list, as it can be done with a few clicks online.
Here’s how you can enrol your name on the voter list:
Visit the website of the Chief Electoral Officer , Telangana and click on the ‘E-registration’ tab on the top of the homepage.
Select the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab from the drop down menu and choose the ‘ Form 6 ’ from the options given there.
In the form, select the option ‘As a first time voter’.
Accurately fill the form with the required personal details, like name, address, date of birth, etc.
Upload scanned copies of the required documents for proof of address and age, along with a photograph of the applicant.
Click submit.
The applicant will then receive an application reference number that serves as a receipt as well as a tracking number.
After the application is processed, a Booth Level Officer will visit to verify the details.
Upon successful verification, the voter ID card will be sent by post to the address that has been mentioned.
Important pointers for voters:
If the individual is a citizen of Telangana and already has a voter ID card but it is from a place other than Telangana and he/she has moved back to the state; enrolling in the voter list here is simple. It’s the same as above but instead of selecting the ‘As a first time voter’, select the ‘due to shifting from another constituency’.
On the same website, the ‘ Form 8 ’ under the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab can be used for corrections in the voter ID. If there is a correction in the name, date of birth, address, etc, the Form 8 can be filled with the necessary details and the voter ID will be corrected.
If any individual has shifted their residence within the same constituency, then ‘ Form 8A ’ can be used to transfer their name to a relevant part of the voter roll in the same constituency.
The status of one’s application can be checked under the ‘Assembly Constituency’ tab by clicking on ‘Know Your Status’.

The New Zealand offspinner took seven wickets on Test debut against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi
Unlikely heroes have emerged for New Zealand during the just-concluded three-Test series against Pakistan in the UAE. After India-born left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel took seven wickets on debut in Abu Dhabi to bowl New Zealand to a thrilling win, off-spinner William Somerville took seven wickets as well on his debut, at the same venue, to close out the series 2-1.
Both men began Test cricket relatively late, at 30 and 34 respectively.
Somerville took 4 for 75 in the first innings of the third Test and followed it up with 3 for 52 in the second to hasten Pakistan’s collapse. A sporting declaration left Pakistan chasing 280 on the last day but they were bowled out for 156.
Not too long ago, Somerville was playing first-class cricket in Australia, but he decided to settle back in his home country to boost his chances of playing international cricket.
Born in Wellington, Somerville moved to Australia as a child. He played junior cricket for the Eastern Suburbs in Sydney before he headed to New Zealand for university. He made his first-class debut for Dunedin-based Otago back in 2005.
But he later moved back to Sydney where he played Grade cricket and was working as an accountant before he was selected for New South Wales in 2014-15. However, opportunities didn’t come by as he would have liked as he was competing with spinners Nathan Lyon and Steve O’Keefe. Thirteen years after his first-class debut, Somerville has only managed 18 games.
He was in good form in 2016-17, taking 35 wickets in seven Sheffield Shield games with three five-wicket hauls. Yet, in June this year, the 34-year-old asked NSW to release him from his contract early so he could play again in New Zealand. Bruce Edgar, the former New Zealand batsman, had recommended his name to Auckland.
And so Somerville hopped across the Tasman Sea yet again, and in a matter of months, found himself in the Test squad as a replacement for the injured Todd Astle.

Concentrated solar power requires vast fields of huge mirrors
MIT scientists have designed a system that could store renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, and deliver it back into an electric grid on demand.
The system, described in the journal Energy and Environmental Science, may be designed to power a small city not just when the sun is up or the wind is high, but around the clock.
The new design stores heat generated by excess electricity from solar or wind power in large tanks of white-hot molten silicon, and then converts the light from the glowing metal back into electricity when it’s needed.
The researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the U.S. estimate that such a system would be vastly more affordable than lithium-ion batteries, which have been proposed as a viable, though expensive, method to store renewable energy.
They also estimate that the system would cost about half as much as pumped hydroelectric storage – the cheapest form of grid-scale energy storage to date.
“Even if we wanted to run the grid on renewables right now we couldn’t, because you’d need fossil-fuelled turbines to make up for the fact that the renewable supply cannot be dispatched on demand,” said Asegun Henry, Associate Professor at MIT.
“We are developing a new technology that, if successful, would solve this most important and critical problem in energy and climate change, namely, the storage problem,” Mr. Henry said.
The new storage system stems from a project in which the researchers looked for ways to increase the efficiency of a form of renewable energy known as concentrated solar power.
Unlike conventional solar plants that use solar panels to convert light directly into electricity, concentrated solar power requires vast fields of huge mirrors that concentrate sunlight onto a central tower, where the light is converted into heat that is eventually turned into electricity.
“The reason that technology is interesting is, once you do this process of focusing the light to get heat, you can store heat much more cheaply than you can store electricity,” Mr. Henry said.
Concentrated solar plants store solar heat in large tanks filled with molten salt, which is heated to high temperatures of about 538 degrees Celsius.
When electricity is needed, the hot salt is pumped through a heat exchanger, which transfers the salt’s heat into steam. A turbine then turns that steam into electricity.
The researchers have outlined their concept for a new renewable energy storage system, which they call TEGS-MPV, or Thermal Energy Grid Storage-Multi-Junction Photovoltaics.
Instead of using fields of mirrors and a central tower to concentrate heat, they propose converting electricity generated by any renewable source, such as sunlight or wind, into thermal energy, via a process by which an electric current passes through a heating element.
The system could be paired with existing renewable energy systems, such as solar cells, to capture excess electricity during the day and store it for later use.
The system would consist of a large, heavily insulated, 10-metre-wide tank made from graphite and filled with liquid silicon, kept at a “cold” temperature of almost 1927 degrees Celsius.
A bank of tubes, exposed to heating elements, then connects this cold tank to a second, “hot” tank.
When electricity from the town’s solar cells comes into the system, this energy is converted to heat in the heating elements.

The system could be paired with existing renewable energy systems, such as solar cells, to capture excess electricity during the day and store it for later use."

“I voted for the first time (at the) age of 70... Voting revolution should come... It should bring about a change. I voted with the view that it should bring about a political change”
Balladeer Gaddar voted for the first time in his life in the Telangana assembly polls on December 7.
The balladeer, who campaigned in support of the ‘People’s Front’ (comprising the Congress, the TDP, the CPI and the Telangana Jana Samiti) in the polls, said he exercised his franchise as voting is a tool to bring about a change.
“I voted for the first time (at the) age of 70... Voting revolution should come... It should bring about a change. I voted with the view that it should bring about a political change,” he told reporters.
He called for safeguarding the Constitution and providing jobs to the youth, who form a major part of the population.
Asked why he had changed his view towards voting, he said it could bring about a change and added that voters should decide as per their conscience, the change they wished to see.

Rahul Gandhi
The Congress on Friday slammed the ED raids against Robert Vadra’s associates, saying an “unnerved” Modi government was unleashing “vendetta” against party chief Rahul Gandhi’s brother-in-law to divert the narrative.
The Congress’ sharp reaction came after the Enforcement Directorate on Friday raided the premises of three people linked to firms of Robert Vadra in a case related to assets held abroad.
The searches at the premises of the three people were related to alleged commissions received by some suspects in defence deals, an ED official claimed.
“Sure shot defeat in 5 States unnerves Modi Govt to again use the old tools - unleash revenge & vendetta against Mr. Robert Vadra to divert the narrative,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Twitter.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday conducted searches on the premises of three persons, including two, of what it said, employees of Robert Vadra, businessman and brother-in-law of Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

NSE Nifty jumped 92.55 points.
Benchmark indices broke their three-day falling streak on Friday driven by strength in global equities, sliding crude prices, recovering rupee and a surge in Kotak Bank shares on reports that Berkshire Hathaway was planning to pick up stake in the lender.
The BSE Sensex rallied 361.12 points, or 1.02%, to close at 35,673.25. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty jumped 92.55 points, or 0.87%, to 10,693.70.
Kotak Mahindra Bank was the biggest gainer on both the indices, ending nearly 9% higher following reports that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc was planning to pick up stake in the private sector lender.
According to media reports, Berkshire Hathaway may invest between USD 4 billion and USD 6 billion in the lender by buying promoter stake or through a preferential allotment.
Other gainers included Adani Ports, Bajaj Auto, Infosys, Asian Paints, Maruti, HUL, L&T, M&M, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries, rising up to 3%.
Top losers were Sun Pharma, Coal India, Yes Bank, PowerGrid and NTPC, sliding up to 2%.
Investors also took positive cues from Asian and European equities after U.S. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signalled that the three-year tightening cycle was drawing to a close, and IMF chief Christine Lagarde said that the U.S. was not likely to see an economic contraction in the near term.
The rupee appreciated by 24 paise to 70.66 against the US dollar in intra-day trade amid weakness in the greenback against some currencies overseas.

Parliament proceedings
This will be the last full-fledged Parliament session before the Lok Sabha polls.
The Union government has called an all-party meeting on Monday ahead of the winter session of Parliament to build a consensus for smooth functioning of the two Houses.
At the customary session-eve meeting called by the Parliamentary Affairs Ministry, the Prime Minister usually lists the government’s agenda and seeks the opposition’s support for smooth transaction of official business.
This will be the last full-fledged Parliament session before the Lok Sabha polls next year.
The results of the Legislative Assembly elections, in which both the ruling BJP and the Congress have high stakes, are bound to cast a shadow on the parliamentary proceedings.
Assembly polls results on Tuesday
The results of the polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Mizoram will be out on December 11, when the session begins.
The government would push for the passage of the ‘triple talaq’ Bill pending in the Rajya Sabha. It had promulgated an ordinance to make the practice of instant triple talaq a penal offence.
The government also wants the Indian Medical Council amendment ordinance and the companies amendment ordinance to be passed as bills in this session.
The winter session usually starts in November. However, it would be the second year in a row when it begins in December.
The session was delayed this year due to the five Assembly elections.

They were based on specific inputs of corrupt practices in the labour wards, diagnostic services, mortuary and other departments.
Simultaneous searches were launched in the early hours of Friday at more than 10 major government Hospitals across Tamil Nadu by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC). They were based on specific inputs of corrupt practices in the labour wards, diagnostic services, mortuary and other departments.
Last week, a check was conducted in the Kancheepuram government hospital, where ₹ 45,000 excess cash was seized from the staff deployed in some areas of medical services, sources in the DVAC said.
The allegations are that the staff demand money from attendees of patients in the labour ward and also to inform the details of the newborn such as time of birth, gender etc.
“Our inputs reveal corrupt practices in the radio diagnostic services where patients referred by doctors are forced to pay bribes. Even in the mortuary, there are allegations that the staff demand money for releasing bodies after post-mortem is done,” a DVAC official said.
In Chennai
In Chennai, searches were on at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, the Government Royapettah Hospital, the Kilpauk Medical College & Hospital, the Stanley Medical College & Hospital, the Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for Women and Children and the Egmore Children’s Hospital, among others.
Every hospital had to maintain a cash register where the staff have to declare the cash on hand at the time of reporting for work. The excess cash would be calculated on their declaration in the register. If such registers were not found to be maintained, then appropriate action would be initiated against those responsible for the same, the official said.
Though there were many other allegations of corruption and irregularities across government hospitals, the DVAC had made a beginning with the malpractices involving the Group-D staff, the official said, adding that investigators would also look into the working hours and attendance of hospital employees, particularly the technical staff.
One of the allegations that the DVAC is looking at is the non-implementation of the biometric attendance system, the sources added.

Complaints abound on polling day about names missing from the voters’ list in all constituencies of Hyderabad district.
Famous badminton player Jwala Gutta tweeted about her missing name from rolls. “Surprised to see my name disappear from the voting list after checking online!! #whereismyvote,” she posted on her Twitter account.

Anil Prashant from Domalguda complained that his name alone was missing from rolls, while his parents’ existed. Same was the grievance of Dhaval Patel from Himayatnagar, who returned without voting, despite having the Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC).
In some cases, the rolls did not have names of even the voters who were enrolled recently. “My sister Faria Simran’s vote is missing, though they included her name recently, and we even got a message on mobile confirming that our EPIC is ready. We never received it (EPIC) though,” complained Khaja Mahmood Shariff from Amberpet. Also missing were the names of Shahnaz Begum and Mumtaz Begum from the same constituency.
Confusion prevailed as many voters carrying their old EPICs, as the authorities have failed to deliver the new one with changed ids. Online search with old ids failed to yield results and many people returned without voting.
A number of names were deleted from the voters list after a drive to link Aadhaar with the EPIC. Later, the State Election Commission, through a special drive allowed voters to add their names back in the electoral rolls and provided them new EPICs.
“Our names were included during latest survey. We were promised new EPICs, but they have not been delivered. Now, my vote has disappeared from rolls,” says Mohd. Ashfaq Ali from Amberpet, displaying his old EPIC.
Octagenarian P. Krishna, retired deputy director in State Medical Services, wheel-chaired himself to the polling station at Picket in Secunderabad Cantonment constituency, only to find that his and his wife P.Chandrakala’s names were not there in the list. Interestingly, his daughter-in-law P.Geeta Laxmi’s name was found twice in two booths of the same polling station.

The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Enforcement Directorate to respond to a petition filed by absconding businessman Vijay Mallya against the agency’s move to declare him a fugitive under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act of 2018 in order to confiscate assets worth crores.
A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi issued notice to the ED on Mr. Mallya’s plea but refused to stay proceedings under the 2018 Act to attach a ‘fugitive’ tag to his name.
Mr. Mallya, represented by senior advocate Fali Nariman, has argued that the seizure of his assets on being declared a fugitive economic offender under FEO Act would hamper his efforts from clearing his dues.
Mr. Mallya argues that confiscation of his property forecloses his ability to pay his creditors, probably under a revised offer.
The FEO Act is meant to prevent loan defaulters from fleeing the country to evade legal action. It came into existence in April this year. Mr. Mallya had left the country in March 2016.
A fugitive economic offender is a person who has a waarant of arrest under a scheduled offenve but has fled the country to evade prosecution.
The Bombay High Court had on November 22 dismissed Mr. Mallya’s appeal for stay on the ED proceedings
Mr. Mallya had sought for a stay on the ground that the Appellate Tribunal for Foreign Exchange (ATFE) had already ordered a status quo on the attachments in Prevention of Money Laundering Act case filed by the State Bank of India. A Special Court had earlier dismissed a stay of the ED proceedings despite Mr. Mallya’s stand during September that he was not a fugitive economic offender and not involved in money laundering.
In May 2017, the Supreme Court had found him guilty of willful disobedience of its order to come clean about his assets so that his creditor banks could recover his loans to the tune of ₹9,200 crore.
The apex court had also found him in contempt for not disclosing a sum of 40 million (₹600 crore) received from British liquor major Diageo Plc following his resignation as Chairman of United Spirits Limited in February 2016.
But the apex court, on May 14 last year, had deferred the punishment till the businessman, believed to be in the U.K., was extradited to India and brought before it. The government had assured the court that it was taking steps to extradite him soon.

Notwithstanding GHMC's claims of cent percent distribution of voter slips through booth level officers, several voters have complained that they have not received them.
Govardhan Das (80), a resident of Gunrock in Secunderabad, was sent from one polling station to the other, and returned finally unable to cast his vote.
""Many of us have not received voter slips. We did not know our polling booth, and went around from Mudfort, to Kharkhana, and then to Diamond Point. But our votes were nowhere,"" he said, speaking for himself & his wife.
Residents of Maheshwari Nilayam in Padmashali Colony of Musheerabad constituency too complained that nobody distributed voter slips this time.
Similar complaints were heard in all booths at Khairatabad and Amberpet constituencies too.
Lambasting the government on this, former legislator Chintala Ramachandra Reddy said political party agents had done better job than GHMC during previous elections.
This time, GHMC authorised its booth level officers to distribute the slips, and permitted the party agents only to accompany the BLOs, but not to distribute the slips. The BLOs were instructed to deliver the slips at the doorsteps of voters.
The experiment has apparently failed, going by the experience on the ground.

Telangana
Over 2000 voters in polling station numbers 311,312, 313 and 314 allotted to a private school in Old Alwal were left in lurch as the polling station was shifted to another place without any prior notice.
The polling station located in Loyola High School in Father Balaiah Nagar of Old Alwal in Malkajgiri Assembly constituency has four booths as per the original allotment. But, to the surprise of the voters, they found the school locked and no one to guide them.
Though the school has been shut for over two years, the authorities had still allotted four polling stations. After much invonvenience, the voters were asked to approach Loyola Academy Degree and PG College, located a good two kms away. On reaching the place, voters were told that only two booths 311 and 312 were located there while two others — 313, 314 and 314 A — were moved to St Pious High School in Alwal Hills, 3 kms from the actual polling station.
Venkatachari, a resident of Mangapuram Colony was agitated as he first came to Loyola School and then to Loyola Academy and finally to St Pious High School only to find the EVM not functioning. “We are running from one place to another with no one to guide us,” he lamented as another senior citizen Rajesh of Father Balaiah Nagar, who also came to vote said the printed voter information on the CEO Telangana and Election Commission website still showed the old polling station.
“There are a large number of people waiting outside the old school not knowing where to go,” said Rohit, a techie, who came to Loyola School to vote.
Venkatesh, the polling agent of the Telangana Jana Samiti said he, along with others, had waited outside the Loyola High School station to enter only to realize that it has been shifted.
At the polling booth 314, the situation was chaotic as the voters were told that the EVM was not working. “We have alerted the higher authorities to replace the EVM. It has to come from Bhavan’s Degree College, Sainikpuri,” the presiding officer of the booth Ramakanth told The Hindu.
Polling was normal at booth number 311, 312 and 313 as voters queued up from 7 a.m. There was tight security outside the stations and vehicles were not allowed anywhere near the stations.
Good Samaritan
Mr. Anjaiah, a retired employee of ECIL in Hyderabad, who witnessed the plight of the voters, scribbled the change of polling station and put up a notice board at Loyola High School much to the relief of the voters even as the polling officials were not bothered.

A large number of shops and other business establishments remained closed on Thursday, in connection with the 26th anniversary of Babri Masjid demolition. However, the city remained peaceful.
Several shops and garment showrooms in the important business areas of the old city such as Madina, Gulzar Houz and Pathergatti downed their shutters and the movement of vehicles in these areas was lesser than usual.

Meanwhile, the Civil Liberties Monitoring Committee (CLMC) in a press release issued on Thursday termed the demolition of the Babri Masjid as a ‘blot on Indian democracy and secularism’. It also stated that the demolition was an attack on the identity of Muslims and demanded that the Centre and judiciary fulfil their responsibilities to protect peace and justice. The CLMC also demanded that the those responsible for the demolition be punished.
The Jamiat-e-Ulama Hind Telangana and Andhra Pradesh (Arshad Madani group) general secretary Mufti Mahmood Zubair said that the Babri Masjid case, which he described as a title suit, is being heard is the Supreme Court. The decision of the court should be respected, he said, and hoped that the judgment would be delivered on the basis of documents.

The Election Commission’s promise of distribution of photo voter slips with a route map to the polling station has fallen flat in the city, with many electors not even receiving the slips, let alone the route map.
Only a few electors in the 15 constituencies of the Hyderabad district have got elaborate voter slips with route maps printed overleaf, while practically none in the constituencies falling in Ranga Reddy and Medchal districts have received even simple voter slips.
Downloading slips
However, the tech-savvy citizens have the option of downloading the slips from the Chief Electoral Officer’s website ‘ceotelangana.nic.in’. “I tried, but failed to locate my polling station which is in some nondescript private school. Then I waited for the slip with the route map, which has not been delivered. Later, I tried the map provided on the Chief Electoral Officer’s website, which has failed to load,” complained P. Siddharth, a voter from the L.B. Nagar constituency.
Technical issues
Narasimha Reddy from Musheerabad constituency said he has received the slip, but it did not have any route map. Some voters, however, got the slips along with the route map, but the print quality was so bad that the map did not make any difference to them.
Officials from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) said the maps could not be printed on many slips owing to technical issues.
None of the voters from constituencies falling under the Ranga Reddy district, but part of GHMC, have got the voter slips. Chief Electoral Officer’s office too has no clue about the percentage of voter slip distribution in constituencies outside Hyderabad.
Slow network
With many voters trying to retrieve voter slips from Chief Electoral Officer’s website in the last moment, the network has slowed down tremendously on Thursday leaving many disappointed.
As per the Chief Electoral Officer’s instructions, the booth-level officers, accompanied by political party agents, are responsible for door-to-door delivery of voter slips. The undelivered slips should be returned to the sector officer for safekeeping, to be given back to the booth-level officers on the polling day, for distribution at the polling station.

Former MP calls it conspiracy by TRS leaders
Former Nizamabad MP Madhu Yashki Goud escaped unhurt when a group of people who claimed to be supporters of former Congress legislator Komireddy Ramulu attacked his convoy of vehicles near Metpally town on Thursday night. Mr. Goud blamed Member of Parliament K. Kavitha for the attack.
Reports reaching here said that Mr. Goud was on his way to Nizamabad when a group of persons claiming to be supporters of Komireddy Ramulu stopped his car near Metpally town and damaged the glass-panes of the vehicles alleging that he was responsible for denying party ticket to Mr. Ramulu from Korutla Assembly segment. Incidentally, there were some TRS activists in the group that attacked the convoy.
However, the former MP escaped unhurt. The Metpally police rushed to the spot and dispersed the mob. The police have registered a case and investigating.
The former MP, speaking to the media at Nizamabad late in the night, said that TRS workers in the garb of Congress activists attacked him when he stopped at Metpally enroute Nizamabad from Hyderabad on Thursday night.
“When I stopped for tea at the residence of Dr. Dastagiri, a group of people posing as Congressmen came and engaged me in conversation. In the course of discussion, all of a sudden they tried to attack me but the doctor’s son rescued me. However, they damaged my car. They had come with iron rods and petrol bottles,” he said.
Mr. Goud said that the attack was pre-planned and the conspiracy was hatched by the Nizamabad Member of Parliament to eliminate him for his revelations on the alleged amassing of wealth by her, K.T. Rama Rao and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.
He also said that the TRS regime and its police did not provide additional security to him even as he was getting threat calls for his criticism against them. He said the TRS government was trying to stiffle the voice of all those who questioned its misdeeds and undemocratic attitude.

Old Nalgonda district has sent 400 vehicles for poll duty in 3 districts
Passengers of Nalgonda would have to wait longer, adjust and make space for others on the State-run buses over the weekend with nearly 55% from the fleet allotted for election duty.
The old district of Nalgonda, which operates 730 buses on a daily basis, has sent 400 vehicles for poll duty to the 12 constituencies in three districts. The new Nalgonda gets 169 buses, and Suryapet and Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri are allotted 231 buses.
Officials at the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation here said all the vehicles for poll purpose were dispatched by 10 a.m. on Thursday.
Returning Officers of the constituency concerned, along with nodal officers and the police, have identified routes, and through distribution and reception centres, the required material was handed over to officials. They were transported to respective polling stations on RTC buses. Electronic voting machines were transported amid high security using depot garage transporters.
Speaking to The Hindu, Regional Manager here, S. Madhusudan said bus operations would be rationalised in the wake of election service. Frequency of buses, plying between major routes like Nalgonda, Suryapet and Hyderabad, would go up from 10 to 30 minutes, while in a few places, operations are minimised.
“Thursday evening and election closing hours on Friday will see a lot of rush. A depot manager here is in charge at L.B. Nagar to supervise the situation,” he said.
Officials said the Election Commission has hired each bus for a specific rate of ₹20, 000 per day, ₹6,000 more than the usual running rate, to compensate for early reporting of buses on Thursday and delays after the whole process.
Normal operation of buses on all routes will resume on Saturday.

Bike expedition by women officers of Indian Army comes to an end
Six women bikers of the Indian Army were surprised by a barrage of innocent questions posed to them by school students in rural India, as they set out to promote awareness about women joining the Army as well as women empowerment.
The officers of the Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME) had left on a week-long sojourn from Bhopal, reaching Secunderabad after halting in Mhow (Madhya Pradesh), Vadodara (Gujarat), Mumbai, Pune and Solapur (Maharashtra) as part of the 10th reunion celebrations of the Corps of EME under the banner of ‘EME Naari Shakti Motorcycle Expedition’.
The team included Capt. KU Roji, Lt. Priya Kashyap, Maj. Deepti Bhatt, Maj. Gazelle Sareen, Major R.K. Nirban and the expedition leader Lt. Manmeet Kaur.
Spreading awareness
Their purpose was to make people aware about the idea and possibility of women taking up positions in the Indian Army, something they found was altogether unknown in rural parts of the four States they visited.
Talking to The Hindu on their return to Secunderabad, the officers recounted how school children in rural areas had no awareness of women’s recruitment in the Indian Army and were also clueless about women empowerment. One of them said the students asked them if women were allowed to use guns in the Army, go to the battlefield or fly fighter jets, and so on.
“They were so innocent. We have answered all their queries and tried to motivate them to join the forces,” said Major Nirban.
The officers rode for 1,720 km. to mark women empowerment, spread awareness on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s programme of ‘Beti Bachao’, Beti Padhao’ and motivate young girls to join the armed forces.
Through their seven-day road campaign, the team members also interacted with Veer Naaris, Armed Forces veterans and college students.
Lieutenant General Paramjit Singh flagged in the expedition, which was attended by actor Amala Akkineni and Dutee Chand, a double silver medal winner in women’s 100 metres and 200 metres at Jakarta Asian Games.
The concluding ceremony was also attended by a large number of serving officers, veterans, schoolchildren, including girl students of the Army Public School, Bolarum.

Vehicles to start between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., with routes changing every two hours to cover all areas
The physically challenged and disabled persons in the city will be carried to the respective polling stations through vehicles organised by GHMC.
For their convenience, 150 vehicles have been deployed throughout the city, with staggered routes so that the disabled voters can be picked up from their doorstep and taken to the polling station, the District Election Officer M. Dana Kishore said, after flagging off the vehicles on Thursday.
The vehicles will start between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., with routes changing every two hours so as to cover all the assigned routes. This will last till the end of the polling.
Mr. Kishore appealed to the drivers of the vehicles deployed to ensure that they cast their votes before 8 a.m. so they can join the duty.
He also appreciated the efforts of student volunteers who are coordinating the transportation arrangements, and said they will be paid ₹600 by way of remuneration.
There are about 18,000 voters with disabilities in all the 15 Assembly constituencies. With the help of VAADA app, mapping has been done to pick up the voters from their residences.
A GHMC release informed that all poll arrangements have been completed in the city’s 15 constituencies.

Winning candidate will have diverse issues and demands to grapple with
Serilingampally may be nestled in the neighbouring Ranga Reddy and Medchal districts, but reflective of Hyderabad in many ways.
Small pockets retain an old-world charm, while several areas have morphed into a preferred destination for families from different corners of the country. It is home to globally renowned firms in the field of information technology and ITeS, a fulcrum of sorts for the growth Hyderabad is witnessing.
All this has meant that the Assembly constituency finds itself grappling with issues that invariably accompany a fast-paced transformation, one whose main trigger is the appreciation in realty prices.
For the candidates aspiring to become MLA from Serilingampally, this translates into dealing with a diverse range of issues and demands, from basic roads, water, sewerage, stormwater drains, ensuring planned development, improving connectivity, addressing traffic woes, creating facilities on roads for pedestrians, rejuvenating water bodies and safeguarding government lands.
Given that the constituency is home to people from different economic and educational backgrounds, striking a balance will be a challenge.
Making their task difficult is also the extant of the constituency stretching from Nanakramguda, Gopanpally to parts of Kukatpally and covering the fast developing areas of Serilingampally, Nallagandla as well as Gachibowli. Figuring in the constituency limits, in parts or whole, are Chanda Nagar, Miyapur, Rai Durgam, Madeenaguda, Hazeefpet, Kondapur, Kothaguda, Madhapur, Pragati Nagar and Allwyn Colony.
This seems to be a factor coming in the way of intensive campaigning, like in the past when door to door campaign was a norm. The vast areas to be covered and the restrictions imposed by the Election Commission has meant candidates of frontline parties bank on appeal of their leaders.
A total of 29 candidates have tossed their hats into the ring for what would be third such election since the constituency was carved out from erstwhile Khairtabad constituency. Besides the BJP, TRS, TDP and BSP candidates, there are 17 independents and eight others are in the fray.
The contest will essentially be triangular with incumbent Arekapudi Gandhi of TRS; V.Ananda Prasad of TDP as the candidate of People’s Front; and Gajjala Yoganand of BJP locking horns.
Mr. Gandhi won in 2014 on a TDP ticket with a margin of 76,257 votes over Komaragoni Shankar Goud of TRS. Bikshapathi Yadav M. of Congress was placed third with 43,266. In 2009, Mr.Yadav had won with a margin of 1,327 votes over Movva Satyanarayana of TDP, both of whom had this time around filed nominations only to be pacified to withdraw the same.
A lot in this election would depend on the voter turnout, appeal of candidates to voters from beyond Telangana who have made Serilingampally their home and policies of their parties.

District election office had received 16,000 applications
Several employees, who have been commissioned for election duty in the city, have not got their postal ballots yet. This is despite GHMC’s claim that the ballots have been despatched to whoever has applied for those.
A total of 25,000 employees from various departments in the city and surrounding districts have been asked to join polling duty in the city.
While it is customary to deploy teaching staff from colleges and schools for election duty, this time round, employees have been drawn from many other departments, too, owing to staff shortage. “Initially kept under reserve, we all started receiving messages after 11 p.m. on Wednesday, asking us to join duties. This is the first time we are on polling duty, and have not received our postal ballots yet,” says Srivalli from the Food Corporation of India, deputed to Karwan constituency.
Similar is the complaint of Shabana Sultana, a government teacher with vote in Khairatabad and deployed in Yakutpura constituency.
The process of applying for postal ballot is tedious. It requires the heads of the respective departments to prepare a list of the employees on election duty, and submit to the district election officers under whom the employees would discharge their duties.
They would be issued application forms or Form-12, which need to be filled and returned along with identity and address proof. The required number of ballots would then be sent to the respective returning officers whose duty it is to ensure delivery to the employee. This time, forms have been distributed and collected at constituency-wise training camps conducted in the city.
The district election office at GHMC has reportedly received 16,000 applications for postal ballot, of which 5,200 were from city-based employees. They all have been sent the postal ballots, while for the remaining staff who are from outside the city, the ballots have been despatched to the returning officers concerned, they say.
Missing ballots
Meanwhile, G. Harshavardhan Reddy, official spokesperson for the Congress party, claims that more than 20,000-22000 postal ballots have gone missing across the state, and attributes it to the carelessness of district election officers. “District collectors, who are DEOs, are counter-accusing employees of not submitting applications. My question is, whether they cared enough to issue acknowledgement slips to employees from whom they have collected application forms during training camps,” Mr. Reddy says.
He has submitted a representation to Chief Electoral Officer Rajat Kumar urging him to address the issue, with the latter assuring that all employees would be given the ballots. However, given that the postal ballots need to be counted first, before the counting of direct ballot begins, it cannot be assured that they would reach in time.

Model polling stations to making polling a comfortable experience
A red carpet welcome awaits voters at the all-women managed model polling station designated as ‘Mahila Adarsha Polling Kendram’ located in the Ricca Bazar Government High School here in Khammam constituency, going to polls on Friday. Arrangements have been made to offer a red carpet welcome to the voters to make voting a pleasant experience for the electors, said an officer assigned the task of decorating the model polling station. The model polling station has been decked up to create elector-friendly ambience under the overall supervision of Collector and the District Election Officer R. V. Karnan.
Apart from provision of drinking water and other necessary amenities, signage with slogans on ethical voting and details of the polling booths have been put up on the precincts of the polling station, the officer said.
A total of five all-women managed polling stations have been set up one each in Khammam, Palair, Madhira, Wyra and Sattupalli constituencies as per the Election Commission’s directive to promote greater participation of women in the electoral process.
Women form a formidable force of the total electorate (10,85,167) in the district.
Female voters (5,52,598) outnumber male voters (5,32,493) in the district.

Except T. Vijayasimha Reddy from Congress in 1989, the eight successfully elected between 1978 and 2014, completed their terms in the opposition. However, N. Bhaskar Rao who won on the Congress ticket in 2014 switched over to Telangana Rashtra Samithi and is its candidate for this election.

Voters in two gram panchayats can vote in both Telangana and Maharashtra; but get a few benefits from both governments
Being citizens of two States would normally have voters enjoy double the government provided benefits but, the 4,311 voters of Parandoli and Anthapur gram panchayats, which are administered by both Telangana and Maharashtra governments, now find themselves neither here nor there.
As both the States are involved in a territorial dispute over an 80 sq km stretch of land located on the inter State border falling in Kerameri mandal of Asifabad (ST) Assembly constituency of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district in Telangana and Jivti taluka of Chandrapur district in the neighbouring State, they get to administer the dozen villages under the two gram panchayats which have a population of 5,769, most of whom are Marathi speaking SCs.
“Initially, we got benefits from either side but since the last few years, however, we are getting only rations supplied by both the States under Public Distribution System,” revealed Laxman Kamble, sarpanch of Parandoli representing Maharashtra government who, incidentally, was first elected sarpanch from the then Andhra Pradesh side in 1994.
Lost benefit
“We have water tanks built by Telangana but it goes abegging as Maharashtra does not supply electricity,” he quoted an example of how dual administration can actually harm the interest of the voters in Bolapathar, Isapur, Anthapur, Gowri, Arkepalli and Paraswada in Anthapur gram panchayat and Karanjiwada, Anarpalli, Lakhmapur, Kota, Parandoli and Jankapur in Parandoli gram panchayats.
The major demand of the villagers, who get to vote in elections on either side of the border by virtue of holding electors photo identity card from respective States, is rights on forest lands being tilled by them.
Crop loans
“We do not mind which State gives us the right but we want pattas to our lands so that we can access institutional crop loans and the power supply connections,” Prasiddha Khandare, an educated youth from the village pointed out.
“We have forest land spread over 100 sq km in the disputed area of which 80 sq km has been encroached upon by the villagers. They are tilling these lands since the 1950s,” stated Kerameri Forest Range Officer Syed Mazharuddin.
Forest lands
Incidentally, Maharashtra Forest department lays no claim to the forests in the area. “They have left forest protection to us,” the FRO disclosed.
“The Forest department does not permit even laying of roads,” complained Gangadhar Shinde, Parmeshwar Ingle and Mohan Kendre who were seen walking on the 6 km hilly stretch to reach Malepur, the nearest village where they can get an auto to reach Kerameri mandal headquarters. The RTC Adilabad Region has suspended the bus service after the existing dirt track got damaged in last monsoon.
On the positive side, Maharashtra government has a well maintained primary health sub-centre in Parandoli, the largest of the dozen villages. “For better health care we still need to go to Adilabad which is a painful exercise,” Mr. Khandare pointed out.

Election authorities ensure electronic surveillance at all polling stations
The plans of the State election authorities to ensure live webcasting of the election proceedings on the polling day appear to have not fructified.
From the initial efforts to put in place webcasting facilities in a majority of the polling stations, except those which did not have connectivity, the authorities concerned have now reduced the number to 3,478 polling stations from where the live webcasting of poll proceedings would be made.
This is little above 10 % of the total polling stations numbering 32,815 including 241auxiliary polling stations.
Infrastructure constraint
Senior officials said the district officials had been asked to submit reports relating to feasibility of BSNL network and status of electrical connections at the polling stations.
They were directed to inform the CEO’s office about the availability of broadband, WiMAX modems with BSNL as well as web cameras available in the respective districts. However, the authorities concerned decided to confine the number to around 10 % was reportedly taken following the shortages felt in mobilising the required equipment to cover majority of the polling stations. “The Election Commission wanted live webcasting to be made available from at least 10 % of the polling stations as it could be taken as a sample to monitor the process,” Chief Electoral Officer Rajat Kumar said. There would, however, be arrangements for recording the developments through CCTV cameras, laptops along with web cameras for recording the proceedings. There would also be 100 % electronic surveillance in all the polling stations as the proceedings would be recorded and the CDs relating to them would be submitted along with the completion of the election process.

Applications invited for fresh enrolment
As the stage is set for the elections to Legislative Assembly on Friday, the State election authority has decided to re-launch the revision of electoral rolls from December 26 for preparing authentic electoral rolls for the Lok Sabha elections scheduled towards the middle of next year.
The election authorities have invited applications from the youth who are likely to cross 18 years by December 31 to apply for inclusion of their names in the fresh electoral rolls so that they can exercise their franchise in the elections to the House of People. The names of these youth were expected to be included in the voters lists during the publication of fresh voters lists on January 4. However, with the election to the Legislative Assembly being advanced consequent on the dissolution of the House, the authorities revised the regular summary revision of electoral rolls by a couple of months and published the final voters’ list on October 12. Chief Electoral Officer Rajat Kumar said the voters who could not enrol their names because of age factor or other reasons should come forward to enrol themselves in the fresh lists. “Given the enthusiastic response we got through receipt of 33.5 lakh claims and objections in a short span of 15 days, we are hopeful that the response will be much higher this time,” he said.
While the focus would be on fresh enrolment, electors could also utilise the opportunity for rectification of errors, if any, relating to their age, name, relationship status and other issues. “Rectification of voter lists will be the next step to ensure that the rolls become pure,” he said.

Surrounded by thickets of green, artworks and sway-worthy music, the Family Festive Brunch at Hyatt Gachibowli’s Collage is colourful cornucopia of edible wonders
Those who brunch on a regular basis will find something special at the Family Festive Brunch at Collage, the Indian and Italian restaurant at Hyatt Gachibowli. A menu that changes weekly, dependent on the chefs’ plans is just not worth missing. Before you bemoan the distance to Financial District, take note whatever energy you lose in driving or hailing a cab, you will surely regain once dining is underway.
There’s an encouraged al fresco experience at the Family Festive Brunch, which is ideal given the Hyderabadi winters are just comfortable enough to lounge about in the sun — be sure to pack a hat or a sunscreen. Plus you have to be on your feet for this one. While the servers are very accommodating, the fact that the live counters hold a sight to behold is motivation to get yourself out of your seat.
Families litter the space, kids in bright-coloured clothing bounding about between the tacos and nachos live counter and the french toast live counter, screaming at the tops of their lungs in sheer excitement at space to roam and the mouth-watering smells.
Chef de Cuisine chef Surender Singh explains that a lot of thought has gone into assembling the brunch spread, neither wanting flavours to clash nor wanting to overwhelm the diners. A team of 38 chefs are active in this endeavour led by chef Surender and Chef de Cuisine chef Uday Kiran. Sous chef Shankar Raj Pande handles the delicious Asian spread, Chef de Partie Pasunkill Gowri keeps the Indian cuisine classic and centred while sous chef Biswajit Purkait maintains the eye-catching prettiness of the pastries and bakes section. It’s a sight to marvel, all 38 chefs resembling a flock of geese in their whites and towering hats balleting all over the place.
From the tenderloin with avocado and tomato confit to the avocado and green apple soup, the enviable salad spread covers your five-a-day in a single round. Just like Joey Tribbiani wanted to warm up his stomach for a festive meal in that one Friends episode, this course as well the dedicated cheese stand will have you wanting more. Be it the brie of the vibrant yellow of gouda, it’s all good enough for the endless varieties of breads and crackers — all made in-house.
The desserts are hit-or-miss here, especially since there’s so much excitement over the plethora of entrée and main course options. And what’s brunch without a lavish beverage spread? A mixology stand manned by Hyatt’s resident singing bartender Prithvi and his team offers anything borne of drinkable creativity — twists upon classic daiquiris to fresh-out-the-press juices.
The Family Festive Brunch is open every Sunday from 12:30pm till 3:30pm at Collage until December 23. Call 8886218855 for reservations. Rates ₹1699 non-alcoholic, ₹2199 alcoholic

Over one year or more, Prashobh’s road trip has made him richer with more friends from across the country
It is more than a year since Prashobh I L has been home. This former User Interface (UI) designer quit his corporate job to pursue a dream that kept resurfacing every now and then — to set out on a bike to tour ‘parts of the country’.
Following that dream was however not that easy, especially when it came to convincing his mother. “This desire to tour was like a cry. I realised it has to be now or never. There are certain things one does best when single. Once a person is marriedthings change. After I made up my mind, I made a rough sketch of my plan and broke the news to my mother. I lied to her initially. I said I would be gone for two months. She didn’t speak to me for a week; it took me one month to convince her and also prepare for my ride on the sly. I assured her that she will be updated about my rides, I will call her thrice a day depending on the network and also do video calls when my brother is around,” recalls Prashobh. He also promised not to ride at night and make sure he is in some safe place before night fall or dusk. His only motivation is to experience his own country first-hand and then think of travelling abroad, he claims.
Friends in Hyderabad
To equip himself for the journey, Prashobh sat with the local mechanics in Kerala to see and learn work in terms of running and maintenance of the bike.
Prashobh set out from his home in Trivandrum on August 5, 2017. Now Prashobh feels he is closer to the end of his bike ride. He made a pitstop in Hyderabad to meet Chaitanya Muppala and his wife Harika Vedula whom he met at a road pass in Nagaland. He will also see the places around the city.
Chaitanya and Harika hiking the Dzoku valley  
The couple was doing a northeast tour on their Benz BLE and then entered Thailand. “Our meeting was quite sudden. We were at a pass to enter Arunachal and Prashobh happened to be there as well. We were quite surprised that he was on his two-wheeler for more a than a year. In that quick stop and meeting of a few minutes we exchanged numbers and went about our way, still being amazed at the guy’s journey and mode of transport. His warmth and enthusiasm made us look forward to doing the trip once again” says Chaitanya.
Unlike other bikers, Prashobh isn’t riding a super fancy machine. His mode of transport: Hero Honda Karizma. “I am very comfortable with my bike. It has given me good company. Since I didn’t deadline my ride, I feel very relaxed. I started from Kerala and went West, then rode up North, Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim then entered northeast and spent more than six months there,” says Prashobh as he swipes his phone album to show the places he visited.
Partial to the northeast
Having toured most part of the country what is Prashobh clear favourite” He turns a bit emotional. Like a father who cannot choose favourites he says, “Every State has a different charm, every place has a different warmth and vibe. Every place is special to my heart because people opened up their home to me even without me asking for it. Some offered food, some others offered road tips, some shared their home and some guided me to their favourite spots which are away from the likes of Nat Geo traveller. But I will be a bit biased to northeast. That place has a charm like no place and the people are the warmest. Despite resorting to gestures for communication (as he does not know the languages) we made the strongest bonds. During my ride in Nagaland I was tired after making my way through mud and slush and I was stuck on the road. As I sat there, not knowing what to do, some villagers saw me, took me and hosted me. That hamlet belonged to the tribe of head-hunters but I think they were the warmest. The chief of the village called me a few days ago to see if I am doing fine. It makes my eyes moist to think how well I was treated in the region,” says Prashobh once again showing photographs of the people and places he stayed in NE.
Like Prashobh, Chaitanya and Harika too are in awe of the northeast region and the ‘new’ food taste bowled them over. When he started his journey, Prashobh missed coconut oil for days and the smells from unfamiliar cooking oils almost threw him out of gear. “I couldn’t stomach the smell and the taste. I ate only to survive. By the time I was in Sikkim and Nepal, I was on instant noodles. In northeast I was amazed at the amount of pork people ate and reared; that was my problem initially. After that, my six-month long stay there goes to say how comfortable I felt,” adds Prashobh.
Prashobh is in Hyderabad only because Chaitanya invited him; he is very humbled by this friendship and hospitality. As they caught up, Chaitanya sits back and listens to the fantasy ride which Prashobh is on. “Vedika and I love road trips and are amazed at the amount of time Prashobh spent on the roads of India,” says Chaitanya as the couple listen to his road tales like two kids at a story telling session.

A city startup is designing merchandise that tell stories about urban culture, in an offbeat way
When Karthik was working in Malaysia, he was astounded at their collection of memorabilia. Apart from the ubiquitous keychains, magnets and ‘I love KL’ T-shirts, small tin cans on the shelf surprised him. “Tin mining is the oldest in Malaysia; so unless you know a lot about the country tin cans memorabilia didn’t quite make sense to me,” says Karthik.
Karthik Lakshmanan along with Madhusudhan Boga founded K&M city souvenirs to to promote Indian cities and their culture through what he calls their ‘kiraak’ designing. Currently they have over 100 products for five cities — Hyderabad, Amaravati, Chennai, Kerala and Bengaluru.
‘Landmarks, language and lives’ is their design motto.
Karthik explains that each magnet has four elements. For instance, a close observation of a Buddha statue magnet, shows the connect it has to the kings of that era. Other magnets chronicle the city’s evolution with iconic landmarks from different eras.
The concepts aim at ‘standing with an open heart’. “Before opening our mouths to speak, we should first open our hearts. The idea is for people to connect to places, its roots, culture. Some people take some time to do it, some connect instantly. That is where the cultural quotient helps; that’s where the real connection happens. Speaking hastily makes us judgemental; that’s where we begin making boundaries and go back with a very boxed idea of the place and people one visits,” says Karthik.
K&M city souvenirs have a separate set of collection for Andhra Pradesh, Bangalore, Chennai and Kerala.
Their aim is to make collectibles for each Indian city. The numeric 29 in their website 29km indicates 29 Indian states and KM stands for their company.
Their poster collection of Idioms will be made for the south Indian states.
Their products come in various series. The Indulgence series includes T-shirts, magnets, button badges, name plates, home decor, books, luggage tags, key chains, mugs, and lapel pins. ‘Lite teesko’ (written in Telugu) is one of the messages on a T shirt.
They plan to come up with a series with Exuberance (for art and crafts products) and Fantasy (kids products). “Once we build the connect then gaps and the borders between people, language and culture will reduce. This informs our vision: To make an impact in the world by making tools for the heart that celebrate our culture,” adds Karthik.
A lot of research goes into the design to make it fool-proof. Especially when history is involved and details like using the royalty like the Nizams; saying which, did you know the official shade of the Nizam kings was yellow?” points out Karthik.
This involves the partners touring the cities apart from reading up on that city’s history, people and culture. “A lot of information also comes from interacting with people . this way e also get a feel of the pulse, understand what is trending and will never fade. For instance the word ‘Nakko’. late actor Mehmood had popularised it so much that the moment someone from another city meets a Hyderabadi, they flaunt their ‘nakko’.
The K&M collection is available on www.29km.in.

The future of the world’s water lies with this generation’s ‘green revolutionaries’ like INKtalks 2018 fellow Gary Bencheghib of Make A Change World
Looking back on his career as an activist and documentary filmmaker so far, Gary Bencheghib has a lot to humble-brag about — or even just straight up brag. On his way to India to speak at 2018’s INKtalks in the city, he has quite a unique story to tell, and it’s not one to miss in the age of everything-going-green.
A long-time fan of INKtalks, Gary says, “I have friends here in Bali who are environmentalists and they’d done previous talks at INKtalks and it’s considered quite a big accomplishment to do these talks. I’ve always admired them in their career; there’s John Hardy who founded Green School as well as his daughter Elora who founded Ibuku. My girlfriend along with her sister founded an NGO called Bye Bye Plastic Bags. Over the years of being in this realm, we got introduced to INKtalks. I feel really honoured to speak this year; I applied as a fellow so I’m excited to be given this stage to share for the first time what we do.”
Making more than changes
Make A Change Bali (later named Make A Change World) was pulled together in 2009 with a mission in mind close to Gary’s heart: to keep the beaches and rivers of Bali and greater Indonesia clean, back when eco-activism wasn’t as popular. They started by cleaning up the beaches, working with schools and friends. Through film and other visuals of their work, the momentum picked up. Then came #PlasticBottleCitarum in West Java on August 14 last year, a project in which Gary and his brother Sam set out to kayak down the world's most polluted river. The catch? The duo had built a kayak out of plastic bottles and the journey down the polluted river was filmed. This instantly went viral and from there, it progressed globally, with expeditions in Bali and the United States so far. Make A Change World now has Gary’s sister Kelly on board, making it a full family venture.
Power to the visual
Clearly social media and video are integral components of Make A Change World’s arsenal in relaying messages which further urge us to save a fast-deteriorating world. While the 24 year-old is looking to link up with fellows and attendees at the conference, he is also excited to speak of the possibilities of such connections. And one of those is starting something up in India. “Reflecting upon our expeditions and videos of when we went down the Citarum and down the Mississippi, it feels right to do something in India; do a first glance at the scene and see what’s possible. With the tools we have at our fingertips, we have the power to create change. With the use of video and bold ideas, anyone can contribute to big change. We don’t necessarily have to wait for governments and corporations but we are in a time where we need massive collaborations so we truly have to put ego aside and see how to amplify the volume of on-ground people who have dedicated our lives to fighting for this cause.”
India’s rivers and beaches are in trouble, environmentally and structurally. With the Yamuna and the Ganga being the most polluted rivers in the country, the numbers are proportionately terrifying. According to a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report in 2015, more than 60,000 million litres of urban sewage is generated daily in India. But cities around the country have an installed sewage treatment capacity of only 38% of this. Gary and his team have a lot to prep for and he’s well aware, he says, adding, “As holy as they are, we hope to work with local partners. But it’s all in the preliminary stages at this point, but we do know we’d have to localise it and work a different approach.”

One of the most profound things Gary has taken away from his journey so far is the need to challenge the masses as well as authoritative figures and institutions and hold them accountable for the state of our planet. “If we’re are going to be the culmination of everything happening in the world, we have to think of tomorrow. We don’t have the luxury of waiting so being young itself is considered an amazing tool. Those as young as 13 give amazing keynotes at the United Nations. Kids are realising they can be ambassadors for movements against social problems. We have really evolved as a generation. That energy is inspiring and links to the urgency. And we can definitely approach policy-makers and corporations and ask them the real questions and ask for real action.”
He elaborates, “In our expedition in Indonesia, we uploaded the video online and two weeks post the expedition, after a ton of sharing, we were invited by Sudirman, the waste management director of the Environment and Forestry Ministry, to see the director’s emergency plan to organise the clean-up and maintenance of the Citarum. Soon after the Indonesian President gave his support too.” Seven thousand troops were deployed to the river, and about 70 industries based alongside the river which were illegally dumping waste were closed down.
Such a project and impact can only get a person more geared up — and Gary doesn’t shy away. “I’m actually flying out in about three hours,” chuckles Gary as the chat winds up, “so I’m looking forward to experiencing more of India.”
Gary Bencheghib will be speaking at INKtalks 2018 for the ‘Moments of Realisation’ session on December 1 at 4:30pm at Trident.

The Oscars
As ShortsTV makes a new home in India, the visibility of short film storytelling just scooped up a potential viewership of 1.3 billion more
There’s nothing like the satisfaction and lasting afterthought invoked by a well-crafted short film, be it Chutney by Tisca Chopra, Feast by Patrick Osborne and Kristina Reed or Eleven O’Clock by Derin Seale and Josh Lawson.
The buzz at the ShortsTV launch event in Hyderabad on November 28 wasn’t based just on the anticipation for more hours on the couch watching television, but more around the affecting narratives which mainstream films often shy away from. The ShortsTV team have already been to Mumbai, the first leg of their tour, and are to finish the final leg in Delhi.
Shorts International Chief Executive and Member of the Academy Carter Pilcher moderating a panel comprising Academy Award-winning producer Kristina Reed, Governor of the Short Film Branch of the Academy Jon Bloom, and ShortsTV Acquisitions Consultant and filmmaker Chintan Sarda  
Having launched in the United Kingdom in 2008, the channel now available in India is dedicated to screening Academy Award-nominees and winners in the short film categories, animated, documentary and live-action.
Breaking into an Indian market is no small feat, so naturally, the link-up with Tata Sky is strategically subscription-based with the first five days being free followed by a monthly charge of ₹75. By the calendar year-end of 2017, Tata Sky’s subscribers count crossed 16 million — 24% of the country’s DTH subscriber count.
Additionally, in the Netherlands, last year, ShortsTV launched a mobile app as well — and with Indian demographics’ love for mobile, there’s room for that here too.
A focus on animation and tech
Producer and Academy Award-winner for Animated Short Feast (2014) Kristina Reed is excited for the future of the animated short and in Hyderabad, there’s no scarcity of talent. “What drives me about the business of animation is that it’s a labour of love — it takes a lot of people to work on an animated film and I love working in teams. Animation, in particular, draws in a lot of design talent, technical talent and great storytellers.”
Still from 2016’s ‘Garden Party’  
There’s a symbiotic relationship between animation and shorts and Kristina, who’s been on board for feature films such as Frozen, Kung Fu Panda and Big Hero 6, elaborates, “The main reason Disney and Pixar do short films is to, two-fold, test new technology and help grow talent and leadership roles on projects which have lower stakes than a feature film. Paperman and Feast — which used Hyperion, the rendering system built for Big Hero 6 — were both born out of exploring the visual look that was possible to put on-screen and emotion and not have them look like anything else. The short film space is the perfect space in which to practise to learn and hone concepts and technologies you don’t know yet.”
Still from 2017’s ‘Death Of A Father’  
Plus, in a world of lessening attention spans and ‘try-hard or die-hard’ habitual binge-watching, short films are experiencing quite the revolution over the extended film. Jon Bloom, Governor of the Short Film Branch of the Academy and known for his Academy Award-nominated 1984 live-action short Overnight Sensation, chuckles as he contemplates this notion, “The expectations of audiences are going in the opposite direction, rather, with the advent of Netflix and other streaming services really challenging the feature film. While these platforms offer series available to watch in one go, there is a renaissance happening in short films as well, where they’re finding a new place in that mix of media. There was a time in the theatres, long ago, where shorts were shown as part of the whole evening — now we want trailers and ads.”
What the world doesn’t see
Jon Bloom chats about the nominee-selection to which process not everyone is privy, “We begin with eligible films and those films become eligible in one of two ways: winning a category in a film festival we recognise such as Cannes or Sundance, or by having a one-week theatrical release in Los Angeles and that’s something for which, generally, the filmmaker will pay. This year, as an example, Sundance had around 12,000 shorts. At the Oscars we had 140 live-action and 80 animated shorts which were eligible, out of which the process begins to create a shortlist which is a top ten curation which becomes the five nominees everyone sees.”
Carter agrees laughingly, “One can promise themselves they’ll watch just one, but there’s a chance they’ll end up watching a dozen and not even realise it. Audiences who are younger tend to not watch things that are longer than 15 minutes, if you’re looking at things from a YouTube or web-series perspective.”
A spotlight on India and on women
Recognition for Indian shorts on a global stage is lacking, as Carter points out, and it’s something he and Jon are actively trying to change through collaborations with film festivals in India. They’ve already teamed up with Bangalore Film Festival to hone in on local talent and to urge Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image (MAMI) to engage in more accreditation with the Academy in the United States.
Chintan Sarda, an acquistions consultant for ShortsTV, shares an insight about having been to Hollywood and bearing witness the shorts buzz created around his Jackie Shroff-live-action-starrer Shunyata which won at Best of India Short Film Festival last year. “As an Indian filmmaker, I feel the pinnacle of where someone can go with their film is the Oscars. Most of us believe it’s not really possible, but with short films it is — it’s such a democratic space where you can make a short and go to festivals and you have the freedom to experiment with the medium and your voice.” With the evening’s focus on animation, Chintan hopes for more discourse into the unseen hard work which goes into the final product millions end up seeing.
Still from 2017’s ‘Shunyata’  
With her favourite short films being about and around women, Kristina describes how the democratisation and diversification of short films at the Academy has opened up a long-sealed chasm for female filmmakers. This year’s Bao by Domee Shi is a favourite of Kristina’s for its mythological richness and moving references to family dynamics. “We love new voices and new stories. In any way, if we can help women be heard more, it makes for leaps and bounds in the right direction. We are already struggling with gender equality and its global. In the United States, we are consumed by what’s in our bubble trying to change the halls of power over there and seeing the #MeToo movement in India culminate is encouraging.”
Still from 2017’s ‘The Silent Child’  
Down the line, perhaps channels and platforms such as ShortsTV will affect how we watch the upcoming Academy Awards seasons. While many of us watch the red carpet and scroll through to the end to see who’s bagged Best Director, Best Feature Film and Best Actor and Best Actress, more audiences will wait with bated breath who’s won the three categories for the shorts too.

Bombay Jayashri and Abhishek Raghuram’s different styles blended beautifully to give the Hyderabad audience the perfect concert experience
Multiple musical genres, several styles, many moods, and varied languages — ‘Yatra: A Journey Within’ was a richly aesthetic confluence curated and presented by Carnatic musicians Bombay Jayashri Ramnath and Abhishek Raghuram. Their performance with five accompanists at Ravindra Bharathi was the opening programme of the three-day The Hindu November Festival, 2018, in the city.
Besides the two renowned vocalists, the Yatra ensemble included Murad Ali on the sarangi, Ravichandra Kulur on the flute, Praveen D Rao on the keyboard and harmonium, Ojas Adhiya playing the tabla and Anantha R Krishnan on the mridangam. The instrumental music blended beautifully with the vocals and each instrument also received space for brief solos at various points in the concert.

Yatra’s homage to the rich mosaic of Indian musical traditions started off with the gentle and somewhat melancholic strains of the sarangi, followed by Subramaniam Bharati's Enda Neramum. Next came Jitendra Abhisheki’s well-known Marathi composition, Tejonidhi Lohagol which is a pean to the Sun God and his divine effulgence. We have heard it often with Lalit raga and here Kalyani and Panthuvarali flowed in.
Padams followed, or rather excerpts from them, each seguing into the other. Kshetrayya’s masterly creation Ososi Naa Madi (Mukhari) was an ideal choice for the first one, after which the vocalists moved on to Panimati (Ahiri) and finally the padam beginning Thaliruboniro better known as Aligithe (Huseni).

After the languorous padams, it was time for a change of pace with a very brisk Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma renderd in Nand raga rather than the Madhyamavathi or Shree we are accustomed to hearing it in. It was an exuberant rendition and the flute, keyboard, tabla, mridangam and sarangi all contributed to the joyous mood evoked by this song in which the goddess of prosperity is invoked and invited. This was an innovation by Abhishek Raghuram, we were told.
The main piece of the evening Kamala Vadane Kanjalochani Devi was an experimental piece that was composed by Raghuram, as Jayashri later revealed. It was preceded by a brief explanation by Murad Ali on the significance of the ragas Malhar and Bahar. That was a good hint of things to come — a Carnatic-style composition with Hindustani classical-music flavours.

The opening saw Jayashri in her element. We heard the soothing, gentle-textured, bhava-laden rendition that has won her countless admirers. Sangathis and swaras sparkled and danced as Abhishek Raghuram soon joined in giving a Hindustani music touch at many points and especially during the neraval which often resembled taans. Kamala Vadane culminated in a dazzling crescendo, and the style and nature were both Carnatic and Hindustani.
The percussionists who had been playing a competent though subdued role till now, came into their own. The spirited tani avartanam and sawal-jawab between Ojas Adhiya on the tabla and Anantha R Krishnan on the mridangam drew deserving applause from the audience.
A male and female voice performing a Carnatic music concert together presents a big challenge of shruti management but both artistes handled this with elan. Actually, the combination of Jayashri and Raghuram was as interesting as it was delightful. Jayashri’s music is known for its gentle, meditative style while the hugely talented Raghuram tends to be flamboyant and hence they complemented each other perfectly.

An exquisite tillana of Lalgudi Jayaraman, Dheem Thanatha came towards the end with the words ‘Mangalakara Mahadeva Shankara’ presumably providing the mangalam element which is mandatory at the end of a traditional Carnatic music concert. Yatra’s finale had a patriotic note with Vanda Mataram rendered as a short and sweet piece.
Indeed, Yatra was all about pluralism and presented a rich tapestry of various Indian music forms. Vocalists formed the lead but Yatra also gave the instrumentalists from diverse backgrounds sufficient room to showcase their individual traditions even while making them a seamless part of the overall narrative. This musical journey or adventure if you would like to call it so, was also evidently conceived to have as pan-Indian an appeal as possible. And it worked well on all levels.

Sonu Nigam livened up the evening in Hyderabad with his incredible stage presence
A Sonu Nigam concert comes with the entire package. The veteran of innumerable concerts now can operate even at a mechanical level and still deliver what the audiences seek. The ‘High on Music with Sonu Nigam’ concert attracted a big number of music fans even though the Balayogi Stadium in Gachibowli is another world away for music lovers in the other part of the city, who also have to beat the peak traffic on Friday.
Nevertheless, for those who turned up, Sonu Nigam delivered as always. His fans, who have seen him perform on numerous occasions would say he wasn’t as exuberant as he usually is, but that dip in form was only visible to the trained eye.
An excellent mix of peppy numbers and slow melodies made sure everyone went back home happy. There were the occasion warnings, one of them really stern, to those being a nuisance. There was the humour, delivered with immaculate timing that made his fans laugh aloud. There was the complimenting, and the dancing – he is really good with his moves – that the crowds thoroughly enjoyed.
He started with Deewana Tera, followed by the delectable Hans mat pagli pyaar hojayega from Toilet, with the wisecrack toilet humour that finally, something good has come out of a toilet. There was Kabhi Alvida Na Kehana, which very few sang along leading him to remark that very few in the audience were probably born when the song was released. The decibel level really turned up with Suraj Hua Maddham, and after raising the bar higher with Ye Dil Deewana, he cooled things down with Tune jo pal bhar mein. After following this up with Soniyo, Sonu sent the audience into raptures praising them for the way they tunefully sang his lyrics unlike in a lot of concerts, where the intent is there but not the rhyme or rhythm.
Things got really romantic under the cool winter evening with Mere haath mein tera haath ho, which was slowly built up into Hum hai rahi pyaar ke. This was followed by a mashup of old numbers like Jai Jai Shiv Shanker and Mere Sapno ki Rani, getting huge cheers from the audiences. There was Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, where Sonu improvised with rap and bhangra beats. There was some fun too, where after Main Agar Kahoon’s tune, Sonu used his trademark mimicry to make the audience, waiting for one of the most anticipated songs of the evening, laugh at Babul ki dawai leti Ja.
The highlight of the evening was probably the rock version of Saathiya, one of the highlights of Sonu’s career. Soneya Dil Se Milale Dil ensured the energy was high enough right till the end.
All in all, it was just another brick in the ‘wall of fame’ for Sonu, who could probably sleepwalk through such two-hour concerts. Nevertheless, it seemed, for most people in the audiences this was a memorable evening, spanning songs across couple of decades that they could sing along and even be praised by their idol.

Remembering Prabhakar Kusuma, the Hyderabad photographer who was among 2018’s Fellow of The Royal Photographic Society (FRPS), UK
On Thursday, the Hyderabad photography community lost one of its unsung heroes — Prabhakar Kusuma. The 66-year-old reportedly passed away following a cardiac arrest. The soft-spoken photographer was a mentor for several budding photographers and a trusted friend to members of Telangana Photographic Society.
Prabhakar was selected as Fellow of The Royal Photographic Society (FRPS), UK, and one among the four people worldwide to be chosen in 2018. He was the only recipient from India this year. And, the last time a photographer from the Telugu-speaking states was bestowed with this honour was 31 years ago.
When we interviewed Prabhakar at his residence in Begumpet (published in The Hindu MetroPlus dated June 18, 2018), he reminisced anecdotes from his four decade long career in photography.
A photograph from Prabhakar Kusuma’s series on a home for destitutes in Warangal  
He recalled going through a rough phase and buying eight 35mm films that were three years beyond expiry date since he couldn’t afford new ones. While the new films were priced at ₹200 each, the old ones came at ₹5 each. This was in 1993 when he wanted to shoot the inmates of a destitute home in Warangal. Twenty images that he selected from this series shot over eight months, fetched him the FRPS recognition 25 years later.

Prabhakar moved to Hyderabad in 1995 and to tide over financial needs, worked in the advertising industry. He simultaneously took up other photography assignments. Advertising was his bread and butter but photographing people and lifestyles was what he loved the most.
His interest in photography began in the 1970s, when as a school student he was introduced to dark room techniques. “I saw how images came into view and I knew this is what I wanted to do for a lifetime,” he told us.
‘The Destitute’ series was also showcased as part of Indian Photography Festival 2018 held in Hyderabad. Prabhakar was also a contributor to The Hindu and Business Line in the 90s.

Pankaj Mohan Aggarwal enchants the city with his art featuring prominent embodiments of manthan, maya and kalachakra
Stepping into Iconart Gallery, the atmosphere has transitioned to be a lot more calming given the space is known for its more socio-political works. This welcome switch is due to the careful compositions of enchanting artworks by 71 year-old Pankaj Mohan Aggarwal who’s known for his takes on dhyana, an umbrella word for contemplation, reflection and meditation.

Straight ahead by the benches sits the artist, who does not even notice someone has walked into the space; he’s deeply immersed in the canvas sheet before him, pen in hand. His hand movements seem instinctual and his body language is relaxed — no tension at all!
Finally, looking up, he smiles serenely, sets the work aside and stands up and shakes my hand, eager to show his portfolio. In gentle tones, he points to the right wall of the gallery where three pieces of work created separately are assembled together to create one fluid masterpiece. “This is manthan (churning), maya (illusion) and kalachakra (time-cycles) which come together to create what we perceive as our lifelines,” he explains. He adds that working with mixed mediums is integral in signifying the different layers of life and the various elements thrown our way.
These works encompass dhyana with the typical elements of lotus flowers, Buddha, faces in profile, sunbeams and other energy-focussed allusions.
About Pankaj Mohan Aggarwal
Pankaj has been given the epithet ‘monk-artist’ for his dhyana-focussed works
Born in 1947 in Modinagar, NCR.
Attended College of Art in Lucknow from 1964 to 1968
Towards the back of the gallery are similar pieces but in black and white with gilded detailing, perhaps offering up a different artistic vernacular and tone altogether. Take note of the chequerboard in all of these; Pankaj says they’re indicative of the way we have to make mindful choices in life. One will notice that Pankaj has placed himself in every painting, be it as a boat or as a tiny bird with Pankaj’s face — and because these are comparatively small, it should remind us just how large the universe really is.
Along with the canvas works, Pankaj has used silver plates with a mosaic of canvas piece upon which to paint and in the centre of the gallery hang two lanterns inside which are little models of meditation and nature constructed cleverly and carefully with canvas pieces.
Be sure to get to know Pankaj through these works if you pop by Iconart Gallery; he’s a treasure trove in India’s art community. The main peg with Pankaj’s works — and this is what countless artists strive for — is that, while his masterpieces are eye-catching, they leave quite a lasting mental and emotional impact on the beholder.
‘Zen’ by Pankaj Mohan Aggarwal is on display at Iconart Gallery until November 21.

Sharat Katariya’s brushstrokes in 'Sui Dhaaga' may have got much more broad than in his previous outing but you still end up caring for his characters
It’s tough to imagine that a stitching test — the race to sew a pillow cover to eventually win a sewing machine — could send your pulse racing but it does happen in Sui Dhaaga. It’s because you care for and feel one with Mauji (Varun Dhawan) and Mamta (Anushka Sharma) and their race to self-reliance — turning Mauji’s tailoring talent into an enterprise. After all, who doesn’t like an underdog to reach her/his goal?
Sui Dhaaga
Director: Sharat Katariya
Cast: Anushka Sharma, Varun Dhawan, Raghubir Yadav, Namit Das, Puja Sarup
Storyline: Happy-go-lucky Mauji, with a big push and lots of help from his wife Mamta, turns his tailoring talent into an enterprise
There’s more that is likable about the film. The whimsical vignettes of ordinary lives — the lack of intimacy for the young couple, the primacy (over everything else) of having water pumped into the house tanks, reaching out for amchoor (mango powder) and lemon pickle to relieve oneself of flatulence. The family and community dynamics, their togetherness despite the squabbles feel real and bitter-sweet. Then there’s the larger arc of giving a thumbs down to commercially exploitative appropriation of tradition and its mindless harnessing for mass-production as against the purity of craft and its distinct stamp on the individually made garments. So what if all of it is eventually done on screen in the ironic shade of a brand like Raymond.
In the telling of this consciously inspirational tale filmmaker Sharat Katariya’s brushstrokes get too broad, his telling a tad too heavy-handed. The characters swing between the extremes of black and white, of the good and the bad with some exaggerated portrayals of villainy, right from the son of Mauji’s former employer to the fashion designer boss to the oversmart middleman. All, incidentally, played by competent actors like Ashish Verma, Puja Sarup and Namit Das respectively. The hero and heroine, on the other hand, are way too goody goody for comfort, the performances too come marked with a tear-jerking, self-aware earnestness. The truly real soul then is Raghubir Yadav, Mauji's bickering father.
The resolutions — both of the film and the squabbles with family, neighbours and friends within the film — come pat and easy, the play on Mad(e) In India grates and the end credits, obviously inspired from Aditya Chopra’s own Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, are not half as inventive as the original.
Ultimately Sui Dhaaga pans out like Lagaan — a rag tag team hits a sixer on the fashion ramp; the hoi polloi earn the approval of the gentry. It is a tad flat in comparison to the more layered quirkiness of his previous outing, Dum Laga Ke Haisha, but you still care and root for Katariya's characters and can’t help appreciate the fact that the agent provocateur in this film, as in DLKH, continues to be a woman. To borrow a line from the film itself, despite many hiccups, sab badhiya hai (all is well).

‘Devadas’ keeps the spotlight firmly on the bromance between its two lead actors
Take the title of this film seriously. It’s more than a hint that its mainstay is the coming together of Nagarjuna (as Deva) and Nani (as Das). Their bromance and the resulting fun is the movie’s crux and several other parts get swept to the position of ‘also-been-part-of-the-ride’.
Director Sriram Adittya takes his time to establish these two characters and their backgrounds. A lot of people in the gangster world and the police force supposedly don’t know who the dreaded Deva is. The aura is built up as though Deva is omnipresent, invisible and can strike any moment, anywhere. Had this been a thriller, intelligence officers and spies will have their hands full. Here, despite all the mystery surrounding Deva, only a small group of cops headed by Murali Sharma is on the lookout for Deva.
On the other hand is doctor Das, befitting the definition of ‘Ramudu manchi baludu’; he’s looking to begin his career at a swanky corporate hospital and when he steps into its portals with reverence, you know things will go awry. ‘MBBS, MS, gold medallist’ becomes his tagline and later he gets nicknamed as ‘gold-u’ by Deva.
Das knows his subject but doesn’t know the knack of handling an ego-ridden senior and is soon thrown out. It’s hard to believe that he will not land a job anywhere and will have to set up a clinic in a rundown building, sharing space with a compounder who’s actually a tailor! Where else but in a masala film would you find such predicaments.
The film begins thus on a shaky premise but once the actual meeting of Deva and Das happens, leading to hilarious situations, we settle in for a jolly good comic ride. Credit goes to Nagarjuna and Nani for making this bromance worthwhile. Some of the comic segments are well constructed and it’s fun to watch these two actors bring the house down, often, with their impeccable timings.
Devadas
Cast: Nagarjuna, Nani, Akanksha Singh and Rashmika Mandanna
Direction: Sriram Adittya
Music: Mani Sharma
Nagarjuna breezes through his part and is impressive with his trademark suave demeanour. And we don’t mind the occasional self-aggrandising references to Manmadhudu and his ease with romance. Only, in this film he’s yet to win the girl. Notice how he stresses while pronouncing Jah-navi (references to another famous Jahnavi?). Akanksha Singh has a pleasing screen presence (as Jahnavi) but, but… how does a supposedly senior journalist believe someone is a CBI officer without cross checking? You’re expected to enjoy the comic bits, sure, but the film would have been stronger had it paid some more attention to its character sketches.
Talking of the fun part, the scene where Nani tries to sing ‘vaaru veeru’ in Jahnavi’s presence is a laugh aloud moment. Nani is terrific as the timid guy stuck between gangsters and cops. He has that ‘why me?’ look constantly and shows the frustration well.
While the camaraderie between Nag and Nani is a treat to watch, the niggles can’t be overlooked. Several others get short changed with under-written parts — Srinivas Avasarala, Murali Sharma and Kunal Kapoor (my first thought — Telugu cinema made a lacklustre baddie out of this dashing actor too?). It would have been good to have them do something impactful within their limited screen time. In that sense, Naresh and Rao Ramesh get a better deal. The segment where Naresh thinks Nag is a sexologist is a hoot. Vennela Kishore with his green tea fixation is another character that could have been used better. In a better written film, Rashmika Mandanna, once her true identity is revealed, would have made a better impact. The romance between her and Nani doesn’t really come through.
Despite all this, if Devadas holds attention, it’s because Sriram Adittya knows how to utilise its two leading actors and serve up plenty of fun moments. In the end, he gets Deva and Das to look at life from each other’s perspectives with some melodrama.
A special mention to Mani Sharma’s music. Apart from the hummable ‘Vaaru Veeru’ and ‘Emo Emo’, he seems to have had fun with the background score. It’s a predictable pattern to have classical notes for Das and a Western, gangster mode for Deva, yet, it adds to the fun.

The rustic tale of sibling enmity provides an abundance of wisecracks
Pataakha has everything that makes it a perfect fit in Vishal Bhardwaj’s oeuvre: literary adaptation, feisty women, rustic hinterland, unapologetic use of dialect and free-flowing gaalis. Yet, the film doesn’t feel contrived or formulaic.
Instead, the humour is raw and earthy and the impudent simplicity of the narrative is refreshing. There’s no dearth of Hindi films that exploit rural settings and characters for laughter but Bhardwaj’s latest doesn’t stand on the periphery pointing fingers while guffawing. It immerses itself in the dust and grime, the quirks and ordinariness of a small town. The authenticity that emerges can safely be credited to its source material, a short story, Do Behnein, and its Rajasthani writer Charan Singh Pathik, who was inspired by the rivalry between his sisters-in-law.
Like most siblings (and India-Pakistan, as the film insists), there’s no reason for Genda alias Chutki (Sanya Malhotra) and Champa alias Badki (Radhika Madan) to squabble and get into (rather fierce) physical fights. But unlike most of us, they never outgrow their enmity and find newer ways to annoy each other even as adults. Both are bellicose and ambitious but one wants to pursue education and become a teacher and the other wants to drop out of school to become a dairy entrepreneur.
But this fundamental disagreement isn’t as instigating as the comical narrator Dipper Naradmuni (Sunil Grover), who seeks utmost pleasure in being the chaabi (provocateur) in their lives. Bearing the brunt is their “bechara bapu” (Vijay Raaz) and their stalkers-turned-boyfriends-turned-husbands played by Namit Das and Abhishek Duhan.
The appeal of the film rests heavily on one-liners and name calling that flies around throughout the narrative, even as the constant fighting gets repetitive and tiresome occasionally. Chutki and Badki are foul-mouthed girls who use everything from the regular “chorni” and “kuthiya” to more silly profanities like “looj mosan” and “kabj” (constipation), while their husbands have terms of endearment like “meri Bloody Mary” (used when Chutki is angry). There’s plenty to savour in the language and verbal exchanges, some of which are bound to pass over your head due to the sheer speed with which they are delivered.
Aided by a rustic mise en scène, the film limits its geographical exploration largely to a village, which helps you empathise with how smothered the two sisters feel while trying to actualise their ambitions. You often see shots of regular villagers who stare blankly into the camera, adding to the (unintended) humour.
Despite being loud-mouthed beedi-smokers, Chutki and Badki aren’t stereotypical rebels. They also radiate a sense of innocence and naivety, which is comfortably executed by Malhotra and Madan, who are uninhibited in their roles (but could do with less browning of their faces). It’s heartening to note that despite marriage being a major plot point, men aren’t the pivot of their lives - in fact, in many ways, the husbands are a stepping stone towards their goals. Even during their courtship, the women are in charge, as much as the men are made to believe otherwise. The characters and their situations are definitely an exaggeration, but sometimes it takes hyperbole to drive a point home with humour.

An outstanding anti-caste statement that deserves to be seen by all
When the lines ‘caste and religion are against humanity’ appear in the first frame of a film, you know that you’re in for a hard-hitting couple of hours. But it is entirely to director Mari Selvaraj’s credit that he slips in this message subtly into a moving tale that chronicles caste issues in Tamil Nadu.
The film opens with Karuppi, the dog that’s now famous thanks to the popular number. It’s 2005, and the dog’s looking out at a passing train, even as its trainer Pariyerum Perumal (Kathir) is chatting with his friends nearby. And then something happens — and this is within five minutes into the film, mind you — and we’re moved to tears as tragedy strikes and Karuppi is gone, a bit too soon. “Ellam manusanum inga onnu illa [Not every human being is the same],” goes a line in the song, hinting at what’s coming at us.
The death of Karuppi the dog is affecting — the filmmaking and the song that ensue are poignant — but it’s to the director’s credit that the sadness doesn’t linger. We quickly move on to the tale of Pariyerum Perumal, who is now off to Tirunelveli to study law. “I want to become a doctor,” he tells the Principal there. “Doctor Ambedkar, I mean.”
But everything’s not rosy in college, because of his lack of English skills. His closeness with Jothi Mahalakshmi (Anandhi) is something that puts off her family and friends, who belong to a upper caste. The irony is that all this happens right inside the campus of a law college.
Pariyerum Perumal
Genre: Drama
Cast: Kathir, Anandhi, Yogi Babu
Storyline: A law student from a lower caste has to battle his aggressive upper-caste fellow students
After a few neat jokes, thanks to Yogi Babu, the director settles in for the bigger picture — caste conflicts. Pariyerum Perumal doesn’t flinch from asking tough questions about caste inequality. It shows a mason who indulges in honour killing and reasons by saying that it’s his service to God. It’s no coincidence that the mason has to, much later in the film, target a certain ‘Perumal’.
Caste equality might not exist out there in the streets in the film, but it seems to be in wine shops. When Pariyerum wants a glass of liquor, a man — with three lines on his forehead and wearing the sacred thread [in the wrong way... was that a deliberate touch?] — offers him a glass. Another drinking scene takes place inside the building site of a temple. Pariyerum Perumal is filled with such powerful statements.
Kathir is a wonderful choice to play the lead. Watch him in a scene in which he’s pushed inside a ladies toilet. He’s squirming on the ground but later, when he walks away, there seems to newfound confidence and aggression that he’s discovered. As Jo, Anandhi plays her part well, but does overact a few times. Perhaps it’s no coincidence that she is called ‘Jo’ in the film (in a nod to actress Jyotika).
The film excels in the technical departments as well; Sridhar’s restless camera seems to want to communicate something all the time. Composer Santhosh Narayanan transports you to the milieu with his bag of tunes — while ‘Potta Kaatil’ stands out for its melody, the existential ‘Naan Yaar’ plays around with colour, much like how director Pa Ranjith (the producer for this film) envisioned the climax of his recent Rajinikanth-starrer Kaala.
With such strong statements to make against caste, the film could have easily adopted a dark theme but it prefers to stay hopeful. The climax is easily among its most touching moments. If there’s one film you’re watching this year, it has to be Pariyerum Perumal.

Rima Das’ second feature film moves along gently with the daily rhythms of the place it is rooted in
Rima Das calls Village Rockstars a tribute to the people and place she comes from. True to it, the film is rooted in the daily rhythms of her village of Chhaygaon in Assam. There is a stillness to the frames in the way the camera lingers, both on the landscape and on people’s faces. Both the film, and the life that it brings alive on the screen, are in no hurry to rush anywhere.
Village Rockstars (Assamese)
Director: Rima Das
Starring: Bhanita Das, Manabendra Das, Basanti Das
Storyline: 10-year-old Dhunu, growing up in Chhaygaon in Assam, dreams of owning a guitar but has to face the harsh realities of poverty, floods and more
Run Time: 1 hour 27 minutes
At first look, it seems as if nothing much seems to happen in Chhayagaon. Little ten-year-old Dhunu (Bhanita Das) helps her widowed mother (Basanti Das) at the snacks stall. She makes a guitar for herself out of styrofoam and dreams of strumming a real one some day. Between attending school, harvesting betel nuts, reading comics, learning to swim, playing with her goat Munu, hearing stories from the village elder, saving money for the guitar in the bamboo piggy bank, getting her first period and facing the disastrous floods, there’s a lot actually happening beneath the seemingly static, calm surface.
It’s much like how life is shaped and altered — at times drastically, overnight but usually over a long stretch of time, by the cumulative impact of several, uneventful days.
Right from writing, producing and directing to camera, editing and production design — Das does it all single-handedly. There is something beautifully organic, unadorned and pure about her film-making, deriving most from the “naturalness” of her entire cast of local, untrained, non-professional actors.

Poll: 'Village Rockstars' is India's official entry to the Oscars this year. Is it a good idea to send films that cater to a small demographic?
Das is never hard-hitting but in her own gentle and indirect way, manages to shine a light on the hardships and harshness, the deprivations and disasters underlying the seemingly idyllic, lyrical rural life. There is matter-of-fact acceptance of the vicissitudes; no wallowing in the tragedies, the lacks and inadequacies.
The most appealing is the persistence and simplicity with which Das subverts gendered expectations and norms. Dhunu is not your typical girl next door, doing the usual girlie things. There is something lovely in Das’ portrayal of the adolescent friendships that transcend the man-woman divides. And, even in the thick of the puberty rituals, the announcement of womanhood that she appears to be getting grounded in, there is the implicit reassurance that Dhunu’s free spirit and spunk won’t ever get contained.

A revenge drama that has us rooting for its lead characters, and its director
Fans of director Mani Ratnam can turn up their collars. After three not-so-satisfactory outings at the movies (Kadal, O Kadhal Kanmani and Kaatru Veliyidai), the filmmaker is back – with a big bang – in Chekka Chivantha Vaanam, a strong revenge drama that explores man’s quest for money and power and how it can override even close relationships.
Chekka Chivantha Vaanam
Cast: Arvind Swami, Simbu, Arun Vijay, Vijay Sethupathi, Jyotika
Storyline: The three sons of a dreaded gangster fight for their right to his throne
Most of the first half is pretty much an extension of what we’ve seen in the two trailers; Senapathy (Prakash Raj) is a dreaded gangster who has most of the politicians and the police force in his pocket. His life is always under threat, yet in the very first scene, he’s sneaking out to a temple with his wife (Jaysudha) to celebrate his wedding anniversary. An attempt is made on his life and he’s in hospital.
This gets his three sons together, with each of them getting memorable introduction sequences. Varadhan (Arvind Swami) is much like his father, indulging in extortion and leading the life of a rowdy. The second son, Thyagu (Arun Vijay), is in Dubai and doing well for himself, conducting business with the Arabs on a regular basis. Elsewhere, in Serbia, Ethi (Simbu) is dealing in the arms business, when he’s not out romancing Chaaya (Dayana Erappa).
Senapathy’s ill health gets the three of them together at the base camp. The question on their minds is: Who will take over the throne once Senapathy passes away? Chekka Chivantha Vaanam deals with this solitary question even as it takes you on a revenge tale that chronicles characters in a complicated dog-eat-dog’s world.
The second half is when the real drama kicks in. The brothers are at war, with each of them staking a claim to the name and fame their father left them. Mani Ratnam’s dexterity in tackling complicated relationships shines through here; he chisels his male leads with strong characterisation. You think the three brothers are all against each other, but there’s a secret collaboration happening. You think Rasool (Vijay Sethupathy as a police officer) is just a bystander to all the events unfolding in front of him but he also has other shades in him. You think Chinappa Das (Thyagarajan) is Senapathy’s arch-rival and is plotting his family’s downfall but his agenda doesn’t seem so explicit.
The second half of CCV builds some intricate dynamics between the characters set up in the first. Mani Ratnam’s films have always had meaty roles for its women characters, and so does CCV. It builds them up but barring Jyotika, the other three (Aishwarya Rajesh, Dayana Erappa and Aditi Rao Hydari) are left with little to do, probably due to the film’s crisp 143-minute run time. That also probably explains relegating AR Rahman’s soundtrack mostly to the backdrop, with two numbers running in the background during a fight and an emotional sequence.
While the number of characters and pacing does pose a problem in CCV, the performances make up for it. While the three brothers breathe life into their respective characters, the film belongs to the understated Vijay Sethupathi, who plays Arvind Swami’s childhood friend. He plays to the gallery at times, and yet springs to life at crucial junctures. That he teamed up with a director of Mani Ratnam’s calibre might be the best thing that happened to him… and to Tamil cinema.

On being selected to represent India in T-20 Women’s World Cup
M.S. Dhoni’s team winning the T-20 World Cup in 2007 was the inspiration for Arundhati Reddy to take up the sport and dream big.
Eleven years later, the 20-year-old cricketer is beaming with pride on being selected to represent India in the T-20 Women’s World Cup to be held in West Indies this November.
Huge opportunity
“I was expecting this to happen after my decent performances in the five T-20Is in Sri Lanka. I am thrilled at getting this huge opportunity,” said Arundhati, a junior clerk in South Central Railway.
Looking back at her debut series in Sri Lanka, Arundhati said getting the India cap from Mithali was the best part of her debut.
Interestingly, India captain in Tests Mithali Raj, who is also from SCR, and Arundhati are under the mentorship of coach R.V.S.S.R. Murthy.
“I feel it’s a great honour to play alongside such a great player and I hope to live upto the expectations,” said the all-rounder, who bowls medium-pace.
Learning experience
“In the days to come, I will be a more confident bowler having had the experience of playing for the country against Sri Lanka. In domestic cricket, you don’t really plan to sort out a batter, but at the international level, it was a different learning experience for me,” said the cricketer, who trains at St. John’s Sports Coaching Foundation.
And Arundhati watches the videos of India bowler Jaspreet Bumrah and hopes to master some of the tricks of the trade as she feels he is the best T-20 bowler, especially in death overs.
“The atmosphere in the dressing room was terrific as everyone in the team ensured that I was in a comfort zone. They just told me to go out and enjoy every moment,” she recalled.
What’s the next big dream? To win the World Cup, comes the instant reply from Arundhati, who credits her success to her mother Bhagya Reddy and brother Rohti Reddy, besides her coach.

Young cricketer honoured for his Test debut in the recent England tour
It was an emotional day for Hanuma Vihari when he walked into St. John’s Coaching Foundation on Saturday for his felicitation on making his Test debut in the recent England tour. For, it was here that he fine-tuned his skills as a raw young talent.
Thanking everyone at the venue who have put in efforts to make him a cricketer, Vihari made it a point to owe his journey to all the coaches who spent a lot of time training him and the boys who bowled for him for hours.
Addressing the young trainees, he said, “I am really pleased to stand in front of you and wish that one day, you will go on to achieve bigger things in life and in sport too”.
“I am fortunate to be guided in a right manner at every stage by John sir and of course my mom, who has been my pillar of strength,” he said. Former HCA Secretary K. John Manoj runs St. John’s Coaching Foundation. Mr. John recalled when former Ranji cricketer Nagesh Hammand brought a young Vihari to the Foundation in 2008, whom he referred to R. Sridhar, now the Indian team fielding coach, who was also present on the occasion. “At 12, he lost his father. But he showed fighting qualities. That’s how it all began and now he made us all proud,” he said.
“I must also remind here that Vihari was not originally in the India under-19 squad, but eventually got selected, thanks to the efforts of former BCCI president N. Shivlal Yadav,” Mr. John said. “We are glad that he is the fifth international cricketer from the Foundation after V.V.S. Laxman, Noel David, M.S.K. Prasad and Tarun Nethula, who played for New Zealand,” he added.
Chief guest Mr. Shivlal, who felicitated Vihari along with with former Andhra captain V. Chamundeswaranath, said that the real struggle for Vihari begins now. “But I am sure he will play for a long time for India,” he said.
Mr. Sridhar also traced the early days of Vihari’s evolution from an amazing talent into a consistent batsman in all age groups. “I am sure he has a great future and will live upto the expectations,” he concluded.

Telangana
Struggled hard to muster support of 36 parties at national level for Telangana, says the TRS chief and Telangana Chief Minister.
In what is perceived as a show of strength by the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) ahead of the Assembly elections, the party organised a massive public meeting — “Pragathi Nivedana Sabha” — at Kongara Kalan in the outskirts of Hyderabad on Sunday evening.
The public meeting turned out to be a mega show of strength and an occasion to present the progress report of the government in the last four years. However, the much-speculated announcement of early Assembly polls did not come up.
The party billed the event as the first of its kind in the country and claimed to have mobilised about 25 lakh people. One lakh vehicles, mostly tractors covered with party posters, reportedly transported the participants from all districts to the venue which is spread over 2,000 acres.
Here are the updates:

‘Keshava Rao to lead manifesto committee’

“Telangana stands first in the country in terms of economic growth over 17% for the last four years. In the first five months of this fiscal it is estimated at 17.83%,” KCR says.
“10 years of Congress rule the revenue from sand mining was only Rs.9.6 crore sand mining, but in 4.6 years of TRS rule it has gone up to Rs.1,980 crore.
“We are committed to improve the State's revenue and take up more and more development and welfare schemes for the people of Telangana.
“For minorities the GoI has allocated only Rs.4,600 crore in the budget for minorities development but Telangana Govt has allocated Rs.2,000 cr. in the last budget.
“Every claim of State's development achieved during the last four-and-a-half years is before the people to see and we need not recite everything.
“Welfare has to go up further along with improvement in the State's revenue. Needy sections like unemployed youth would also be taken care of in future.”
KCR says Rajya Sabha member K. Keshava Rao will lead the manifesto committee of the party for the next elections.
He hints at increase in the amount of social security pensions given to aged persons, widows, physically challenged and single women.
“Opposition parties have  single-point agenda of removing KCR from power. I appeal to people to double think about the hurdles of progress,” he says.
He says,“People should think over whether to hand over the decision-making powers to Delhi or to keep with themselves like the people of Tamil Nadu were doing.”
Political decisions will be presented before people in the days to come, he says.
Thus the TRS concludes his speech without the much-speculated announcement of early Assembly polls. But, he has dropped enough hints about such an announcement.
After his speech, begins a fireworks display, which is expected to go on for an hour.

7.05 pm
KCR presents progress card of his govt
After the history of the Telangana movement, KCR now moves on to the welfare measures taken by the first Telangana govt headed by him.
“After achieving the Statehood and coming to power with the people's blessings it was a journey through the darkness in the first six months as we had no idea about our economy and needs.
“The seeds for Mission Kakatiya were sown during the movement days itself as myself, Prof. K. Jayashankar sir and irrigation expert late R. Vidayasagar Rao had long sessions of discussions on how to revive Telangana's basic irrigation sources — minor irrigation tanks.
“Suicides of handlooms weavers at Sircilla and Bhoodan Pochampally had disturbed me and in spite of my pleas to the then government no succour was provided to the community in distress. Now we are able to provide some relief to weavers by giving them work and subsidies on raw material to improve their incomes.
“Our Govt. has distributed 70 lakh sheep to sheep-rearing communities and now the sheep population has grown to over 1 crore.
“Rs. 4 per litre incentive is also being given to dairy farmers supplying milk to cooperative dairies in the State.
“A poor father's grief that he is uanble to marry off his daughter due to financial problems had moved me forced me to think about the initiative of Kalayana Lakshmi, which is one of the 76 schemes which we did not promise in our 2014 manifesto.
“Our Govt. has started a large number of residential schools as part of KG to PG education to extend quality education to children of backward communities of the society.
“What we have done so far for the poor and backward sections are not enough and we need do much more.
“Rs. 5,500 crore given to farmers as input assistance for Kharif cultivation at Rs. 4,000 per acre. Assistance for Rabi cultivation is on the way.
“Rythu Bandhu input assistance scheme will continue as long as TRS is in power. We have also introduced Rs.5 lakh life insurance cover to farmers irrespective of the cause of death.
“Mission Bhagirtha water has reached 22,000 villages already and it would reach in another week days to the remaining 1,300 villages. Tap connections to every household would also be completed before the summer season.
“Reverse migration is taking place in the erstwhile Mahabubnagar district following giving water to about 9 lakh acres last year.”
6.40 pm
Mr. Chandrashekar Rao begins his address after very brief speeches by senior party leaders such as  K. Keshava Rao and Kadiyam Srihari.

KCR says he opposed hike in power charges when he was in the Cabinet of N. Chandrababu Naidu way back in 2001. “But, the then rulers did not heed to my request that it would harm the interests of Telangana farmers who largely depend on groundwater for irrigation”
“Then I started the movement for statehood for Telangana with a handful of people with me. Afterwards, it’s all history as every section of the Telangana society backed the movement for a separate Telangana.
“I had told those along with me in the initial days of the movement that the journey for Statehood to Telangana would gain the momentum along the course.
“I had to struggle hard to muster support of 36 parties at the national level by explaining the justification behind the separate State demand.”
6.25 pm
Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao arrives at the dais. All ears are on the meeting to see what Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao would say. Ahead of the meeting the Telangana Cabinet met, but it ended without taking a decision on the much-speculated issue of early Assembly polls.
Asked whether the issue of Assembly dissolution was also discussed, Deputy Chief Minister Kadiam Srihari said they briefed the media on the decisions taken as per the agenda of the meeting. “There will be another cabinet meeting soon to take more decisions.”

580 buses cancelled, public transport crippled
With the TSRTC hiring out nearly 90% of its buses in the Khammam region for the public meeting near Hyderabad on Sunday, the public transport system was crippled, hitting the commuters hard.
Those bound for various destinations to attend weddings in the peak-wedding season had to depend on private vehicles, at extra cost.

The cancellation of nearly 580 buses of the total 630 buses in Khammam region by the RTC authorities drew sharp reaction from aggrieved passengers. Some passengers entered into an argument with the staff manning the enquiry counter at Khammam bus station on Sunday morning.
Sources said that 105 of the total 125 buses in Bhadrachalam depot and 100 of the total 104 buses in Kothagudem depot in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district were hired for meeting at Hyderabad by the local ruling party leaders by paying the prescribed hire charges in advance.
“There is no rationale in hiring out such a large number of buses for a political party’s meeting, leaving commuters scramble for public transport,” said Ramesh, a passenger bound for Hanamkonda.
TSRTC sources said that a couple of Garuda, Rajadhani and super luxury buses were operated on important routes on Sunday.
The staff at the enquiry counter on the premises of Khammam bus station maintained that the information on cancellation of bus services on Sunday was made public in advance and that the regular operation of bus services will be restored in the early hours of Monday.

Traffic steady on NH65
The Nalgonda police posted at the two toll gates, Kethepalli and Choutuppal on the NH65, said it has recorded close to 1500 vehicles passing through, on Saturday and on Sunday morning.
There was no traffic situation on the highway.
Police say they are maintaining three separate lists, districts-wise — Nalgonda, Suryapet and Khammam — to monitor vehicular traffic.
About 200 vehicles — mostly RTC buses, tractors and private cars — were seen today. The highway is decorated with TRS banners and pink flags on the median, setting the mood for the mega rally.
However, around 22 kms away from here, villagers of Ghatuppal mandal in the district staged protests and took out a rally observing a voluntary mandal bandh. Aggrieved that it was not declared a mandal, Ghatuppal villagers burnt effigy of its MLA Kusukuntla Prabhakar Reddy.

The lead up to the public meeting had a rare moment for a father-daughter police duo who was posted at the venue to supervise security.
Sub-Inspector Umamaheswara Sarma was all smiles as he saluted his daughter Sindhu Sarma, a  superintendent of police who was recently transferred to the Jagtial District and is yet to take charge.
Mr. Sarma joined the duties in 1985 as Sub-Inspector and rose to the level of non-cadre SP over a period of three decades. Sindhu Sarma is a 2014 batch IPS officer who got her first posting at Peddapalli.

TSRTC buses off city routes

A vast majority of Telangana State Road Transport Corporation's (TSRTC’s) ordinary buses were off the scheduled city bus routes on Sunday as they were engaged by the TRS for it's ‘Pragathi Nivedana Sabha’.
However, a large number of buses at the MGBS appeared to be from neighbouring states such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka
Around 67% of the transport juggernaut's fleet was directed to the public meeting.
However, the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station (MGBS), a major route embarkation and disembarkation point, remained abuzz with activity with near regular inflow of passengers. However, a large number of buses at the MGBS appeared to be from neighbouring States such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.
According to TSRTC officials, Super Luxury, Vajra, Deluxe, some Express buses and rear engine buses were operational across the city and State.
With most ordinary buses being unavailable, the TSRTC deployed it's mini buses and air conditioned buses to cater to passenger needs in the city.
TSRTC officials said that they were banking on the long weekend — Saturday, Sunday and Monday (which coincides with Janmashtmi) and expected fewer passengers. They also hoped that awareness about the public meeting would make daily commuters and travellers to plan their journeys much in advance. — Syed Mohammed from Hyderabad

Adivasis stay away

The Adivasis belonging to old undivided Adilabad district have by and large abstained from attending the Telangana Rashtra Samiti's jamboree of a public meeting, Pragati Nivedana Sadassu at Kongara Kalan near Hyderabad on Sunday.
Ethnic people from the mandals of Jainoor, Sirpur (U) and Lingapur in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district even sent away some of the buses which were sent to their habitations for transporting them to the venue early during the day.
Reports said the number of aboriginal people intending to attend the public meeting was meagre from Utnoor in Adilabad district which is the nerve centre of all tribal activity in these parts. There were hardly any Adivasis from Adilabad district head quarters who travelled to Hyderabad.
According to information, only a handful of aboriginal people who are grassroots public representatives or hold some post in the party only went to the meeting from KB Asifabad and Adilabad districts.
The 'boycott' has come in the wake of the ongoing conflict of Adivasis with the Lambada tribe in which the former have accused the government of being a mute spectator and thereby denying them justice.
The call for boycott of the meeting was circulated in social messaging platforms especially in groups which predominantly have ethnic people as members. The messages question the general silence of the government on the question of removing Lambadas from the list of Scheduled Tribes and subjecting them to injustices of different kinds. — S. Harpal Singh from Adilabad

All roads lead to Kongara Kalan, about 40 km from Hyderabad, which is set to host one of the largest public meeting ever witnessed in the State.

Bumper-to-bumper traffic on NH-44
There is continuous flow of vehicles on NH-44 leading to the TRS event. Vehicles on the highway were inching closely in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Since the toll plazas was kept open one side towards Hyderabad, leaving the vehicles without collecting toll charge, there was not much traffic hurdle.
Out of a total of 637 RTC buses in the erstwhile undivided district, 498 buses were hired by the TRS, allotting as many as 83 buses to six Assembly constituencies. Three constituencies Yellareddy, Jukkal and Banswada were given private buses.
By 11 a.m., 125 RTC buses, 65 private buses and 285 toofans/DCMs and 84 cars passed through toll plaza at Indalwai. A total of 559 vehicles passed with TRS activists.

KCR to put off Assembly dissolution
A day ahead of a mammoth public meeting of the ruling TRS here on Sunday, the much-hyped Cabinet meeting is likely to confine itself to ratification of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s populist schemes.
Sources said Mr. Rao was unlikely to pursue his idea of dissolving the Assembly and forcing early elections to capitalise on the “feel good factor in the State”. He will not create confusion at the rally that was primarily meant to present the four-year progress report of the TRS government, they added.

Forgotten and vandalised tombs show the sorry state of heritage
The tip came last week. “There are these maqbaras in Balapur. One of them is double-storied, like that of Jamsheed Quli Qutb Shah. They must belong to someone important. We could climb up and the decoration is largely intact,” said P N Praveen, who teaches architecture. He sent a location map. A satellite map showed a square open area with two round structures.
The location turned out to be beyond the Barkas area in Old City. Beyond the shanty town of Rohingya refugee camps is the open area where the two domes pierce the sky. If shouts and laughter echo from one side where children gather to play cricket, on another side a Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation vehicle comes to dump garbage from the surrounding areas. “I make four or five trips per day,” says the driver of the garbage tipper. When the garbage reaches a certain height, he sets the heap alight. The fire and smoke envelop the area.
The two domes are raised on a square platform. The small, low and squat, more ornate dome would easily fit into the landscape of the Qutb Shahi tombs complex at the foothills of Golconda Fort. The other one appears to be double-storied, but with something amiss with the symmetry. “It lacks a defined parapet with battlements,” says Prashant Banerjee, a conservation architect after seeing a photograph.
“These tombs belong to the Qutb Shahi era. Two Sufi saints Bhole Shah and Bhale Shah are buried here. Over time people have vandalised and removed all signs of the graves but they are buried inside the tombs,” said Muhammad Shareef, who is secretary of the Roushan Ud Dowla Masjid, that abuts the tombs. A sign painted in Telugu speaks about the property being under the care of the Waqf Board. How these two tombs slipped out of the net of the memory of the city is anybody’s guess. The tombs are from a layer of history which hasn’t got much attention from historians.
Golconda/Hyderabad has been attacked multiple times. After Aurangzeb’s final conquest, he oversaw its sack by staying put near the eastern side of Charminar. All the glorious palaces draped with glazed enamel tiles with seven colours were pulled down in the hunt for the fabled treasure.
One of the Qutb Shahi palaces was a seven-storied one which was a marvel for even a well-heeled traveller like Jean Baptiste Tavernier. Now, nothing of that era remains, save the four ceremonial arches, the Charminar and the fountain in the royal piazza. Later, Hyderabad was subjected to a series of raids by the Marathas. The sacking, the raids, the unsettled conditions meant that the once grand city and its surrounding areas slipped into a state where people were only bothered about saving their life and limb. Not surprisingly, religious and spiritual monuments survived intact and in some cases emerged grander and more powerful. But how these two tombs in Balapur, despite being associated with Sufi Saints, slipped into disuse and became a den for vagabonds remains a mystery.

With the fast disappearing arches of Hyderabad, the city is in danger of losing touch with its past
Just outside the Kukatpally Metro station is a grand ceremonial arch painted saffron. It sticks out incongruously in the middle of the concrete jungle, tangled wires and a teeming mass of people swirling around it. The arch is part of the office of a political party. A few yards away is a masjid and at exactly 90 degrees, the road leads to another arch. Parts of the arch are covered in lime wash while other portions have pista green colour.
Both the arches appear at right angles to each other from the Qutb Shahi era masjid in the middle of the township. “There were two other arches but they have disappeared. This area was a vast garden with the family home in the middle,” says Muhammad Ali Khan, a 75-year-old caretaker of the masjid. He is the 10th generation heir of Musa Khan who got the jagir from the fourth Qutb Shahi king Ibrahim who ruled between 1550 and 1580. Ironically, while Musa Khan’s heirs live in Kukatpally, the jagir of Musa Khan is in Moosapet, another Metro station.
Musa Khan
Of different hues These arches in Kukatpally need to be preserved  
“Musa Khan was one of the generals of Ibrahim Qutb Shah. The jagir granted him was spread across 40 villages,” informs Muhammad Ali Khan. It was during Ibrahim Qutb Shah’s time that the native soldiery got prominence. Among them was Amin Khan of Patancheru who created the Ameenpur lake and gardens. Before Ibrahim’s rule most of the top generals in the Golconda kingdom were Persian or African soldiers. It was soldiers like Musa Khan and Amin Khan who tipped the scales towards local talent. While no traces of the gardens exist, the series of lakes in the area and a rare mango tree with wide girth marking the age give a hint about how the area might have looked a few decades back. Musa Khan’s family easily transitioned when there was change of power and the Nizams began their rule from Hyderabad. One of them was Muhammad Sardar Khan who was the Maal Muhatim for the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan. “We had a sprawling house in Nampally near the railway station. I remember going to Baag e Aam (Public Gardens) as a child. There were lions and tigers in open enclosures. But Police Action changed all that. Our family escaped to Qutbe Alam Masjid in Misrigunj for safety. After that everything changed for the family,” says Mr. Khan without a trace of rancour or sarcasm.
The locals call it the Kukatpally Masjid and it is among the few in Hyderabad that have not been spoilt by unseemly additions blocking the view. It is also a smaller masjid with three arches but a luxurious stucco decoration splayed all over the minarets.
A satellite map shows how the planned residential complex might have existed in Musa Khan’s time with a grid like pattern and doorways at right angle to each other. It is only the robust construction of the doorways that has allowed them to exist until the 21st century. But their days are numbered and it only time before an earth mover is drafted to allow smooth flow of traffic. And Hyderabad will lose one more link with its past.

Princess Durru Shehvar ushered modernity into Nizam’s household
The name of Durru Shehvar, the elder daughter-in-law of the Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan, is remembered for the social and philanthropic work she so zealously engaged in Hyderabad. Born in Turkey, brought up in France but married to the son of the world’s richest man, the Nizam of Hyderabad, Princess Durru Shehvar chose to spend her last years in London. She brought modernity to the Nizam’s household and worked for the upliftment of women in Hyderabad.
Her marriage with prince Azam Jah Bahadur, the elder son of the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, resulted in the union of two illustrious Muslim families, the Turkish Caliphate and the Asaf Jahis of Hyderabad. Durru Shehvar, the only daughter of Abdul Majjid II, the Caliph of Turkey was born in 1914 and brought up with modern education, training in martial arts and was intended to succeed her father.
Nizam and the exiled Caliph
In March 1924 after Turkey became a Republic, the Caliphate was abolished and the royal family expelled. Abdul Majjid and his family settled in Nice, a southern French Mediterranean port city. The British Red Cresent Society, friendly with the deposed ruler appealed to Muslim rulers around the world to come to the aid of the impoverished Caliph. Persuaded by Maulana Shaukath Ali and his brother, Maulana Mohammad Ali, Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan decided to send a life-time monthly pension of 300 pounds to the deposed Caliph, and allowances to several individuals in the family.
When Durru Shehvar, came of age, she was sought in marriage by several Muslim Royals including the Shah of Persia and the King of Egypt for their heirs. Shaukat Ali prevailed on the Nizam to send a proposal to the Caliph asking for Darru Shever’s hand for his elder son, Prince Azam Jah. The deposed Caliph could hardly reject the offer from his benefactor.
But it was not that easy; the Mehr (the bride money) of 50,000 pounds that the Caliph demanded for his daughter was “too big”, the Nizam felt. But with the intervention of Shaukath Ali, the Caliph proposed to offer for the same Mehr, the hand of his brother’s daughterNiloufer, for the Nizam’s younger son, Prince Mauzam Jah. The Nizam readily agreed and sent his two sons to France.
The marriage of Princess Durru Shehvar with Prince Azam Jah, along with that of Prince Mauzam and Niloufer took place in Nice, in France, on 12 November, 1931, in a simple ceremony attended by only a simple affair with only the members of Sultan’s family at Nice, a few Turkish nobles and friends as well as representatives of the Nizam — Sir Akbar Hydari and Nawab Mehdi Yar Jung, who happened to be in Europe at that time to attend the Round Table Conference. The Khalifa himself performed the ceremonies. All the offices and educational institutions in the Nizam’s dominions were given a holiday on the day.

Meeting the Mahatma
After a month of festivities in Nice, the Princes with their concerts set sail from Venice to India on December 12, 1931. The ship they were travelling in also contained a star co-passenger, Mahatma Gandhi, who was returning after attending the Second Round Table conference in London. Shaukat Ali, who was accompanying him, having known Gandhi’s sympathy for the exiled Caliph for whose restoration, he pleaded during his non-cooperation struggle, arranged a meeting of the young Hyderabadi Royals with Gandhi on the board of the ship.
However, there was a hitch Gandhi who was traveling in III class would not step into Ist. class where the young couples stayed; nor would the Hyderabad Princes be willing to go to III class where Gandhi stayed. Shoukath Ali, worked out a compromise and the meeting of Gandhi and the newly weds took place in a lounge in the II class.
Active in Hyderabad
In Hyderabad, Durru Shehvar soon identified herself with the people . With a great passion for providing health care and education for common people, she set up a general and children’s hospital in Purani Haveli, which still runs in her name. A Junior College for girls in Yakutpura, Bagh-e-Jahanara, is also run on the funds she provided. She inaugurated the Ajmal Khan Tibbiya College Hospital in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) . The Nizam called her his precious Jewel (Nagina) and encouraged her to participate actively in Hyderabad’s social life. The proud father -in -lawloved to point out how Durru Shehvar was taller than his son. In the company of her friend Rani Kumudini Devi, she rode horses, drove cars and played Tennis. With her beauty and charm, etiquette and dress sense, she transformed Hyderabad’s social circuit.
Durru Shehvar also laid the foundation stone of the Begumpet Airport building in 1936. Until then a small strip at Hakimpet served as the airport for Hyderabad. She ensured her sons, Prince Mukarram Jah and Prince Muffakam Jah, received the best possible western education in Europe and married Turkish brides, as she desired. Mukarram studied in Eton, where India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru had earlier studied. Years later, Mukarram, declared heir to Hyderabad throne, at the suggestion of his grandfather, Mir Osman Ali Khan, served as Honorary Aid De Camp (ADC) to Prime MinisterNehru!
Durru Shehvar was fluent in French, English, Turkish and Urdu and even contributed articles to French magazines. She believed that women should earn their own living and worked hard to remove the practice of purdah. However, there was a great gulf between the Princess and the Prince, Azam Jah and their marriage fell apart within few years. It is an irony that when she was born, her father, the Caliph was the head of all the Muslims in the world; but was overthrown and sent away in exile. After her marriage, Hyderabad state was abolished and integrated with the Indian Union in 1948. She faced fame and power as well as adversary, displacement and agony, all with equanimity, and won the hearts of the people in Hyderabad, where she spent most of her adult life.
Princess Durru Shehvar, after shifting permanently to London, frequented the city. Her last visit to the city was in 2004, two years before she passed away in London at the age of 92. With her death, ended a glorious chapter of Hyderabad.

NGO Thinking Hand hosted a workshop to teach neglected women in the Muslim community how to create low-cost and sustainable furniture
It’s remarkable how much one can learn in the space of a couple of hours. Behind Masjid-e-Ashraf Kareem, a small community centre is abuzz with busy hands of women constructing sturdy-looking structures out of cardboard. The women vary in age from teens to 50s, but the goal is universal: to learn how to keep their families sustained.
Mufti, one of the organisers from Safa Centre Kishan Bagh of Safa Baitul Maal, has long been involved in the betterment of the community’s conditions. With his youngest daughter perched on his lap and occasionally running off to help the workshop participants with the building, he turns to me with bright eyes as he preps to talk about his organisation’s efforts. He says he’s here to just make sure the girls are happy and doing well, especially as he himself has four daughters.

So how far do these efforts to empower the area go back? He recalls a survey he did of a few thousand families in the surrounding neighbourhoods, getting a consensus of the family’s socio-economic situation. He found many of the families have been left without a primary breadwinner — usually a man— who either died, abandoned his family, or was left disabled by an accident. “We wanted to help them,” he states, “because a lot of these women are working as housemaids and that’s not enough to keep a family of four to seven fed, clothed and sheltered.”
Valuable link-up
With a lot of poor working conditions for these women, it felt right to set up a clinic. After doing the preliminary survey, the Safa Centre Kishan Bagh set up a clinic. The clinic operates on an income basis providing coloured cards. For those with white cards, their income will be ₹6,000 to ₹7,000 and their medical treatment and medications would be free. Of the population of the area, 80% are white card-holders. For conditions involving blood sugar and thyroid, the clinic provides medication for the whole month. This establishment operates six days a week from 6pm till 10pm, after a lot of the families would be home after work, observing 50 to 70 patients a day.
During a consequent food drive, Thinking Hand and the Safa Centre linked up, wanting to bring more to area.

Ketham Santosh Kumar is an urban strategist and practising architect who co-founded NGO Thinking Hand. As per the organisation’s name, it aims to go beyond merely lending a helping hand but also to aggrandise and empower the situations of women in rural and/or neglected communities. “I found way too many women here left to fend for themselves while their primary male provider has either passed away or disappeared. It’s been good to see their stories change over the past couple of days.” The workshop has about 10 volunteers from different interactions Santosh and Mufti have had over the years of working.
By building low-cost furniture out of cardboard boxes, the participants are pushed to understand concepts of team-building, communication, architectural principles and concepts, the value of sustainable materials, practicality and pragmatism, time management and how to source material for building.
Chetna, a fashion design student at NIFT, photo-documents the workshops, explaining, “Santosh sir is one of the faculty at NIFT so that’s how I got into the project here. It’s been so wonderful to see how much the NGO is really helping them. Seeing the girls and women this happy is great. This is also a really important skill. It’s been a privilege to cover and to work closely on a project like this.”
One participant of around 14 years says, “I’m learning a lot and it’s good to see these skills will be useful in other places. It’s important to be taken seriously and not treated like I’m supposed to be at home.” She also points out the Masjid by the community centre has also taught her valuable tailoring skills and she’s made many friends there, which helps her feel less alone.
While the community values already exist, organisations like Thinking Hand and the Safa Centre are all about helping the people bring them to the surface.

Command control room to receive complaints from field
After an exhaustive campaign, Congress has set up a command control room to focus on what it alleges is the widespread distribution of liquor and money by the ruling party and campaign for the ruling party under the garb of news.
A 10-line telephone system was set up to receive calls from various parts of the State from the cadre on the alleged misuse of machinery by the ruling party. For the last 24 hours the control room has alerted the officials and lodged complaints with the police on how the ruling party was ‘misusing’ its machinery to attract voters in its favour, coordinator for the control room Gudur Narayan Reddy said.
He claimed that the TV channel run by the ruling party was airing government programmes to lure the voters in its favour like the Kanti Velugu and after its complaint to the Election authorities it was stopped.
Complaints lodged
“Similarly, we received complaints on distribution of money and luring of voters by various other means and the issues were brought to the notice of the concerned officials,” he said.
Though confident, the Congress doesn’t want to leave any gaps in ensuring that the voters are brought to the polling stations.
“Despite all the hard work the most important aspect is the last day poll management that decides the fate. This is more so in a close contest,” a senior leader agreed.
Keen youngsters
“The big advantage is that a lot of youngsters are aggressively campaigning for the party voluntarily as they see a bright future for them only with the Congress,” a leader from Nalgonda district claimed.
Several senior Congress leaders also see this as their last attempt at the hustings given their age, and are determined to win. This sentiment has also been a campaign slogan for many as they tried to attract the rural voters with whom they have long association as MLAs. “One last chance”, was their plea during their campaign. Some of them, however, made all efforts to bring in their children into the poll arena but only a few could succeed.
Sympathy factor
A section of candidates who have tasted defeat last time are also banking on the sympathy factor and they have not left this opportunity as well in their campaign. In key segments like Sircilla where IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao is in fray, his opponent from Congress K. K. Mahender Reddy has been appealing to people to give him a chance.
He has already lost thrice, once with a narrow margin of just over 100 votes.
Another candidate who fits in this category is Vanteru Pratap Reddy, who is locked in a contest with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao in Gajwel.
He is also banking on the sympathy factor that he has lost in the last elections and the allegations that he has been harassed since then.

ECI directions diluted by insertions in local pullouts
Out of 1821 candidates in poll fray in Telangana on Friday, 231 have serious criminal antecedents. But the awareness about the criminal antecedents of the contesting candidates has remained low despite a new notification by the Election Commission of India about disclosure of crime beyond the routine of the affidavits.
“I saw them in the district edition of the paper,” “I saw it in local supplement,” were some of the comments by newspaper readers when asked about knowledge of criminal antecedents of the candidates. “This defeats the purpose for which the EC had framed the guidelines. Many of the candidates did the three insertions in the newspapers but chose the district pullouts or the local supplements for doing so. I want to know what the Telangana Chief Electoral Officer has done? Only two parties have uploaded details of the candidates with criminal background on their websites. The others have not done so,” says Rakesh Dubbudu of National Campaign for People’s Right to Information.
The ECI issued guidelines on October 10, 2018, shifting the onus of publicising criminal cases back to the candidates. The candidates had to issue advertisement in newspapers and TV channels about their crime record.
“Candidates... who have criminal cases against them, shall publish a declaration about their criminal cases, for wide publicity, in newspapers with wide circulation in the constituency area. This declaration is to be published in Format C-1... at least on three different dates from the day following the last date for withdrawal of candidatures and up to two days before the date of poll. The declaration in newspapers should be published in font size of at least 12 and should be placed suitably in the newspapers so that the directions for wide publicity are complied with in letter and spirit,” are the easily understandable guidelines for the advertisements. But this has not happened.
“I didn’t see any such advertisements in any English newspaper. I saw one or two in Telugu papers that too were by non-serious candidates. We informed the CEO. He should have issued a statement about after seeing the poor response to ECI orders,” said M. Padmanabha Reddy of Telangan Election Watch when asked about candidates not conforming to the EC orders.

Anthill Studio Accelerator Programme’s Demo Day saw entrepreneurs showcasing means to enhance viewer engagement in media and entertainment
Stepping into Hyderabad International Convention Centre on Thursday could have made one feel like a kid in a candy store, a hi-tech candy store at that. Investors, studios and content developers discussed concepts around animation, visual effects, virtual reality, augmented reality, machine learning and several other areas of expertise during IndiaJoy 2018.
Keenly following these developments and grooming some of the emerging teams that can facilitate innovations in media and entertainment were also stakeholders from the Telugu film fraternity. At a chat session for IndiaJoy 2018, actor-producer Rana Daggubati highlighted the Indian ability of deriving stories rooted in our culture and the necessity to engage the audience by narrating these stories on multiple platforms — cinema, comic books, VR experience and augmented reality. He was speaking hours after returning from Tokyo, where he along with producer Shobu Yarlagadda received an overwhelming reception for Baahubali.
The Tokyo Comic Con had cos play artists enacting different characters that inhabited kingdom Mahishmati. A special screening of the film, in Telugu with Japanese subtitles, saw hundreds of Japanese filmgoers rooting for Rajamouli’s larger-than-life extravaganza. Incidentally, the two-part Baahubali has been running successfully in Japan, and a special edition of Manga comics has capitalised on the film’s fame. The earlier technique of introducing merchandise on a film is just the tip of the iceberg. Games, comics and other channels enable a larger engagement of audience for a longer period of time.
On the sidelines of IndiaJoy was Anthill Studio’s Demo Day. Earlier this year, Suresh and Rana Daggubati’s Suresh Productions and Prasad Vanga’s Anthill Ventures collaborated to announce Anthill Studio, which identified start-ups for a three-month mentorship and accelerator programme. A clique of seven media and entertainment start-ups — ComicFlix, NewsPlus, RecoSense, Rooter, Saranyu, Scapic and Woodcutter Film Technologies — showcased their strengths at the demo event on Thursday. These start-ups were selected from 150 applications. From showcasing newer ways of aggregating news to using big data to predict box office results, the start-ups hope to be a part of the next leap in the media and entertainment sectors. We’ll focus on some of their work in the coming days. The event also witnessed a discussion between Krishna Durbha of Cognizant, co-founder of Makuta VFX Pete Draper, producer Shobu Yarlagadda, and Raman Kalra of PwC on emerging technologies and challenges.
Start-ups that want to be a part of the next edition of Anthill Studio Accelerator Programme can apply before January 15, 2019. Look up http://anthillstudio.co/

In a hair raising incident of cruelty towards animals in the city, an injured canine was dragged for a kilometre on the road by a rope tied to its hind leg.
The incident was noticed and reported by an animal welfare activist who had rescued the dog and taken it to the hospital. However, the hapless animal did not survive the ordeal.
Ch.Shiva Kumar, business development manager of a private company, and head of the Anti Cruelty Cell in N.S.Ahluwalia Animal Sanctuary, noticed the gruesome incident near Hastinapuram on Sunday.“I was passing by when a man was dragging the dog with a rope tied to its hind leg for close to a kilometre. The animal was wounded in abdomen and in a wretched condition. I questioned the man, but he replied callously that it was just a dog and not human being,” Mr. Kumar shared, lamenting how men fail to see that suffering is the same for animals and human beings.
By the time Mr. Kumar snatched the rope from his hands, the skin of the animal was totally scraped on the side it was being dragged. “I immediately rushed the dog to a facility run by People for Animals, but it died eventually owing to the suffering. I tried to lodge a police complaint at Meerpet police station, but learnt that the area where this incident had happened came under L.B.Nagar police station. I will soon lodge a complaint there,” he said.
Cruelty towards animals is a punishable offence.

Protection of farmers and employment to youth will be the foundation for Telangana’s next government, says AICC president
Minutes before the campaigning time ended on Wednesday evening, the People’s Front put up a united show at a press conference with all its stars sharing the stage and the AICC president Rahul Gandhi announcing that the voice of Telangana was sitting together to deliver the Telangana that people had dreamt of during the agitation.
The press conference attended by alliance partners including Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N. Chandrababu Naidu, TJS president Kodandaram, CPI Secretary S. Sudhakar Reddy, Manda Krishna Madiga, Gaddar, Cheruku Sudhakar and Abdul Ghani of Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) sent a united message which Mr. Rahul Gandhi described that a government with foundation for protection of farmers and employment to youngsters will be in place in a few days.
Mr. Gandhi said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s body language and his abuses at public meetings show the nervousness of his imminent defeat. “The reality is coming to him,” he said. To a question, he said the cadre of all the parties were working in harmony.
Justifying the alliance with Telangana TDP, he said Mr. Naidu came to him with his fears of India under attack from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the very idea of India was under threat. KCR, as a supporter of Mr. Modi, obviously had to be fought together by us, he said.

Mr. Naidu ridiculed the campaign against him that he would interfere in Telangana affairs. It is a false propaganda unleashed by a nervous KCR. There will be a Telangana government here and Mr. Kodandaram will be the convenor of the alliance guiding the government.
He said all the projects in Telangana were either taken up during TDP or Congress regimes except Kaleshwaram and KCR doesn’t have much to claim. “I want both the States to be developed and working together both States can prosper,” he said adding that his role will be limited.
Goebbel’s propaganda
The TPCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy termed the fears of Mr. Naidu’s interference as Goebbel’s propaganda of the TRS and said KCR doesn’t have much to boast about his governance. So he is resorting to such tactics but people are aware of it. AICC in-charge for Telangana R.C. Khuntia, AICC Secretaries Madhu Yaskhi and N.S. Bose Raju and AICC media chief, Randeep Surjewala were also present.

Only regional parties can represent the aspirations Telangana, says MIM chief
Referring to AIMIM as BJP’s C-team reveals the feudal mindset of Rahul Gandhi, said AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday. Mr. Owaisi was responding to questions at a media conference held at Hyderabad Press Club.
“Rahul Gandhi is a Janeudhari Hindu. A Janeudhari Hindu thinks everyone is lesser than him. But the Indian Constitution considers everyone equal,” Mr. Owaisi said. Congress party is losing in elections because of Rahul Gandhi, he slammed. “We need regional parties to represent aspirations of Telangana,” he said, adding TDP and Congress rule brought no development in the region. Telangana’s electorate should not allow Chandrababu Naidu to rule Telangana from Andhra Pradesh, he added.
Mr. Owaisi made an open appeal to the electorate to bring K. Chandrasekhar back to power. Muslim community in Telangana is aware that communal riots have not broken out in Hyderabad after TRS came to power, he said. “The fear factor among Muslims in other States is non-existent in Telangana. AIMIM’s contribution in maintaining peace in the State will be recognised by the electorate,” Mr. Owaisi said. Brushing aside allegations that AIMIM contested in several seats in other States including Uttar Pradesh to split votes in favour of BJP even as in Telangana they fielded candidates only in six seats, Mr. Owaisi said all parties which have “falling political graph think to stay relevant by criticising him”. In Telangana it was AIMIM’s election strategy to field candidates only in eight seats, he explained. He criticised UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for coming to Hyderabad for an election campaign even as a police officer was killed following allegations of cow slaughter. “The accused in the case are Bajrang Dal activists. Now it is up to BJP to decide whether they want to act against Bajrang Dal which is a sister concern of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,” Mr. Owaisi said. He further stated that both BJP and Congress should be voted out of power.

Assembly Elections
Former Congress MP says People’s Front leading in at least 4 of the 10 erstwhile districts in Telangana
Former Congress MP Lagadapati Rajagopal remained firm on his claims that the Congress-led Praja Kutami, People’s Front, made significant inroads in several constituencies and was leading in at least four of the 10 erstwhile districts of the State.
Mr. Rajagopal said the survey conducted by his flash team in the last couple of days revealed that the Praja Kutami gained ground in Warangal too where the TRS was leading till two days ago. The preference of voters was changing fast and he was awaiting reports from another district Nizamabad where TRS was found to be leading initially.
The former MP responded to IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao posting the conversation between the two on Twitter claiming that it had hurt his reputation. Mr. Rajagopal triggered controversy after announcing in Tirumala on December 1 that a good number of independents were winning in Telangana elections and this was followed by another claim on Tuesday when he said the Praja Kutami was leading in four districts as against three by the TRS and there was keen contest in two districts — Mahabubnagar and Karimnagar.
He said the Praja Kutami would form the government after the forthcoming elections if the poll percentage was over 68. The TRS leaders raised strong objections to the reported findings, claiming that the results were being aired at the behest of TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu for creating confusion among the minds of the people. Mr. Rajagopal, however, remained firm on his assessment and asserted that he had shared the details of the findings with Mr. Rama Rao on November 11.
In fact, Mr. Rama Rao enquired about the prospects of TRS during his conversation with him (Mr. Rajagopal) and wanted survey to be conducted in 23 constituencies. Mr. Rajagopal said he had conducted survey by his flash team in 37 constituencies and told Mr. Rama Rao that the Congress was leading. Responding to KTR’s charge that the survey was bogus, he revealed the contact numbers through which Mr. Rama Rao chatted with him.
Mr. Rajagopal said the initial reports of the survey conducted by his teams were in favour of the TRS and he had communicated the same to Mr. Rama Rao.
He said he had in fact suggested to Mr. KTR the need to change at least 65% of the MLAs as there was strong local anti-incumbency factor against them in the respective constituencies. He said he had even advised the TRS to join hands with the TDP and allot a few seats to the party, but the TRS preferred to go independently.
The former MP said he would reveal the full details of his survey after the completion of polling on December 7.

Assembly Elections
Rohingya Muslims or Rohingyas, migrants to the city from Myanmar, are not entitled to vote in the upcoming elections, and will be liable to penal action if they try to do so, a media communiqué from the District Election Officer M. Dana Kishore informed on Wednesday.
As many as 105 Rohingyas have managed to enrol themselves as voters in the city, from various constituencies including Chandrayangutta, Bahadurpura, Yakutpura, Nampally, Malakpet, and Karwan, and got Electoral Photo Identity Cards (EPIC) too.
The oversight was not discovered till the Ministry of Home Affairs sent a list of Rohingya refugees taking shelter here in the city, and provided identity cards by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, S. Pankaja an electoral official from GHMC informed.
Their names could not be deleted as the final list had already been published, she said. A letter to the Election Commission seeking permission for deletion, but there has not been any response. “We have placed them in the ASD (Absent, Shifted, Dead) list under the Shifted head, and booked cases under Representation of People Act. The list of their EPIC numbers have been dispatched to the officials concerned, who have been instructed not to allow them to vote,” Ms. Pankaja said.
In case a Rohingya marked in the ASD list comes to vote, then he will be taken into custody and a case will be registered against him, the press release said.
The city is sheltering a total of 5025 Rohingya refugees, who have fled from persecution by Buddhist State in Northern Rakhine state of Myanmar.

Congress MP’s predictions the trigger
A battle of screenshots began unfolding in the cyberspace, hours after former Congress leader from Vijayawada Lagadpati Rajagopal spoke to media about his predictions for the Telangana Legislative Assembly elections on Tuesday evening.
What began as an exercise in psephology quickly turned into he-said-this, he-said-that back and forth between Mr. Rajagopal and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader K.T. Rama Rao. Mr. Rajagopal spoke to a few media persons and released a screenshot of his survey. Within hours, or exactly at 10.38 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Rao tweeted a screenshot of his conversation with Rajagopal and a message: “The reason I dismiss Rajgopal’s survey as concocted; his message to me on November 20 that TRS is winning 65-70 seats. It’s the same survey he shared today under pressure from Telugu Desam Party chief Chandrababu Naidu with cooked up numbers: I had no choice but to share this conversation to break the conspiracy.”
Things got bizarre after that when another screenshot, albeit a fake one, went viral showing a purported conversation between Mr. Rao and Rajagopal. It took the resident techie of the TRS party, Konatham Dileep, to set things right. He tweeted at 10.04 a.m. to stop the fake news: “The jokers who created a fake screenshot of @KTRTRS WhatsApp conversation do not seem to know that he does not use a profile pic. Better luck next time.”
Incidentally, the Election Commission warns specifically against dissemination of poll surveys and exit polls: “No result of any opinion poll conducted at any time shall, be published, publicised or disseminated, in any manner whatsoever, in or by any print or electronic media, after 1700 hours on Dec. 5, 2018 (December 7, 2018 being the day of poll for the aforesaid general elections) and till half an hour after the closing of poll.”
With Election Commission guidelines in force, it remains to be seen which way the wind blows on December 7.

Maharashtra Minister Pankaja Munde was forced to make changes in her travel plans on Wednesday thanks to getting grounded at Hyderabad airport for about 3 hours. Her chopper, which was supposed to have taken off from Hyderabad for Ichoda in Boath (ST) Assembly constituency of Adilabad district at around 10.30 a.m. when she arrived from Mumbai, could only fly at 1.30 p.m. which, delayed her participation in election campaign for BJP candidates Madavi Raju at Boath and Satla Ashok at Khanapur (ST) constituencies.
Ms. Munde had to change plans as the chopper which dropped her at Ichoda left without her completing her campaign. She left for Nanded by road and from there to Mumbai. She addressed a meeting at Ichoda and reached Indervelli by road where she also paid homage to the Indervelli martyrs before addressing the gathering in Marathi. The gathering comprising Marathi speaking Vanjari community and Adivasis from the mandal received her well. They even raised slogans in memory of her late father and BJP leader Gopinath Munde.
Ms. Munde criticised the TRS and Congress for the backwardness in the State. She compared the development in Maharashtra with that in Telangana and found the latter to be lacking for which she blamed the TRS and Congress.

Beneficiaries not very happy with promises not kept; improper implementation of schemes appear to go against the pink party
The sunlight has faded even though it was only 5.30 in the evening. Three septuagenarians in Pasra, about 70 kms from Warangal, were seen chit chatting at a road side teastall. When asked which party will win in Mulugu constituency. “Congress,” they said unanimously. Why not TRS (Telangana Rashtra Samithi)?
“TRS has launched various welfare schemes but has not implemented them properly,” they said. Are you not getting old-age pensions? “We are getting but not on time. In the past two months, we did not receive them and we don’t know when they are going to give,” they said.
“We have also not benefited from the farm loan waiver scheme. The government paid the money in instalments and we could not repay our loan amount. Now, the Congress has promised waiver of ₹ 2 lakh loan in one go and we believe it will fulfil its promise,” they continued.Some 2 kms away from Pasra, at Govindaraopet, three motorcycle borne farmers also said that Congress candidate Seetakka will win as TRS candidate Ajmira Chandulal is “unpopular” in the area. Moreover, according to them, Adivasis will not vote for Mr Chandulal, a Lambada, this time.
Expectations belied
At Mulugu, two youths said that they expected Mulug to be made a district but Bhupalapalli has been carved out as district. “At a recent election meeting at Bhupalpalli, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhara Rao said that he will form Mulug district. Later, after going to Hyderabad, he said that it would be formed as a Girijan district. Who wants a Girijan district?” they asked.
Not just in Mulug constituency, going by the response of people in some other constituencies, it appears that the Telanagana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is facing headwinds in the erstwhile Warangal district where it had wrested 9 out of the total 12 Assembly segments in the 2014 elections.
According to political observers, the pink party is unlikely to repeat this performance in the ensuing polls. Except for Wardhannapet where the TRS candidate Aroori Ramesh is expected to win comfortably, the race between the ruling party and the Congress-led People’s Front seems to be very close.
People’s connect
In Jangoan constituency, both Congress candidate Ponnala Laxmaiah and TRS contestent Muthireddy Yadagiri Reddy were seen sweating out to secure votes. While Mr. Laxmaiah was seen pillion riding on a motorcycle to visit some of the nearby villages even before 9 in the morning on Monday, Mr. Reddy was found dancing with women in the middle of the road at Shamirpet village in the constituency.
Mr. Laxmaiah said that, except for him , no person has beeen elected from Jangoan constituency twice. He, however, has been elected from the Assembly segment for four terms. He is confident of being elected once again. “People will vote for me seeing my background and the development works I had undertaken. Failure of the TRS government in fulfulling its electoral promises would also help me in getting votes,” he said.
On the other hand, Mr. Yadagiri Reddy said that Mr Laxmaiah was not accessible to the local people. “Ponnala never stepped into the 35 villages in this constituency,” he said adding the the former minister did not anything for the development of Jangoan.
Mr. Reddy said that he has ensured creation of 300 irrigation tanks besides providing drinking water to households at a cost of ₹ 600 crore. He also claimed credit for creation of Jangoan district .
Keen contest
In Warangal West constituency, according to Congress leader Naini Rajender Reddy, the prospects of Telugu Desam Party candidate Revuri Prakash Reddy looked very bleak in the beginning. But, as electioneering picked up, the chances improved and now it “is a neck-to-neck” fight between TDP and TRS candidate Dasyam Vinay Bhaskar, he said.
In Station Ghanpur, Parkal, Bhupalpalli and Mahabubbad constituencies, political observers said, the contest between the People’s Front and TRS candidates is keen while the TRS candidate D. S. Redya Naik in Dornakal constituency is facing an uphill task.

Poll-related developments to be watched for three days
As the curtains came down on the campaign for the forthcoming elections, the State election authorities have put in place a monitoring mechanism for observing the poll process in different districts and getting real time reports.
A dedicated election monitoring cell has been constituted in the Chief Electoral Officer’s office with necessary systems and channels to gather information from the districts on Thursday, the pre-poll day, December 7 the day of polling and a day after polling on December 8. The 17-member team of nodal officers have been entrusted with the responsibility securing statutory reports, election monitoring dashboard reports and EVM reports from the districts at regular intervals as the poll process unfolds.
The nodal officers entrusted with statutory reports should gather information from the deputy election officers at the district level about whether the polling parties along with material for all the polling stations reached safely and whether they are in a position to conduct the poll on the pre-poll day and submit a report to the CEO. The cell would also track begining of polling, polling percentage, facts at glance and comprehensive reports on the poll process towards the evening.
They should also seek information about whether the EVMs reached the reception centres in addition to submitting reports about instances of adjournment of polls and vitiation of poll process like booth capturing. This would be followed by voter turnout and scrutiny reports before evening on December 8.
In terms of dashboard reports, information pertaining to the number of polling parties despatched, number of polling parties where mock poll has been completed as also the number of polling parties positioned at the time of closure of polling. On the EVMs front, they should report about the quality of the EVMs and VVPATs that are replaced during the dispersal, quality of EVMs/VVPATs replaced during mock polling and the quality of EVMs/VVPATs that are replaced during the actual polling.

EC strictures do not stop media houses
“Sir, we would like to do a special programme on you... interview based.” “Sure, am ready,” said a senior party leader. “Sir, the package is like this — ₹....for half hour interview ...₹....for live. We can also run the programme for few days for the party then the price is ₹...”
“Where can I pay that kind of money when we are dependent on donations,” the aghast leader threw up his hands in despair. This happened right in front of newsmen few days ago during one of the numerous ‘Meet the Press’ programmes organised by various journalistic organisations and the Press Club too. While campaigning for Telangana elections has come to a close on Wednesday evening, ‘paid news’ which came into full bloom during the last General Elections has only gone bigger and brazen right under the nose of the Election Commission.
Effective marketing
The EC itself has announced it had found more than a 1000 cases of paid news even as journalistic fraternity whispers and from within newsrooms it is clear ‘paid news’ is much bigger than that.
Grapevine is that several publications and news TV channels have raked in the moolah in the last couple of months with their respective ‘marketing’ teams pushing up the agenda even before journalists take over for news to finalise ‘packages’.
“If the interview is to be done by a prominent or a glamorous anchor the price trebles. For instance, if it was ₹3 lakh for a live interview, it has become ₹5 lakh if a famous personality is involved,” says a deep throat source in the know of things.
Print media too
Newspapers are not too far behind. “We have decided not to have any such news in the main paper. However, it is another story in the supplements and candidates are charged on the number of paras printed in their favour. It could run into a few thousands or more,” says a source.
The price tag rises if the news item is to come in the main paper.

Vote carefully, the CM says at his last public meeting
Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao warned the people of Telangana that danger is looming over the State and people should think twice before casting their vote.
Addressing the last Praja Asheervada Sabha held at his constituency on Wednesday, attended by large number of people, Mr. Rao alleged that Congress leaders remained silent when Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu said there was no water in Krishna river, hence both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh should adjust with the Godavari water. He asked how dare Mr. Naidu propose that.
“This is my 119th constituency meeting and I have the latest survey report. We are going to win 100 seats. Do not get confused with wrong surveys being circulated by some persons. Whichever party wins in Gajwel will form the next government in the State. As my win from here is already confirmed and we are going to form the government,” he said and urged the people to give him biggest majority as it would increase the honour for the constituency. He has also promised to establish pollution-free industries and provide employment to locals.“We had sown the seed of Telangana and now it is sprouting. Nobody expected that we can achieve Telangana, but we did. Now, we must be careful and see that it should not go into the hands of others,” Mr. Rao said adding that leaders and intelligence officials were roped in here by Mr. Naidu to win the elections.
He said Telangana was sold out in 1956 by Burgula Ramakrishna Rao and it was only after his prolonged struggle and almost nearing death that the State was formed.

AICC president charges KCR with being remote-controlled by Modi
The three basic aspirations of a separate Telangana — water, resources and jobs — which the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government failed to fulfil will be fulfilled by the Congress-led People’s Front, All India Congress Committee president Rahul Gandhi said here on Wednesday.
Addressing the last election campaign here in support of Congress candidate for Kodad N. Padmavathi Reddy, Mr. Gandhi accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of corruption in high value contracts and negligence in development and well-being of people.
The Congress president charged KCR (Khao Commission Rao) with making ₹ 50, 000 crore through irrigation projects, and said that he was being remote-controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which was evident in the former’s support for demonetisation, Goods and Services Tax, and dilution of the 2013 Land Acquisition Act.
“Your son’s income increases by 400%, the family has four political jobs, drinks mineral water, and the people are still waiting for jobs, those in Nalgonda have only fluoride-contaminated water,” Mr. Gandhi said.
‘Adopt all districts’
Mr. Gandhi assured the large gathering at the Uttam Padmavathi Nagar grounds here, that things left incomplete by the TRS government will be finished by the People’s Front. And employment to youth, health and education sectors will be top-priority. “Made in Telangana and Made in Nalgonda products will be made possible,” he said.
Disapproving Mr. Rao’s recent announcement of adopting Nalgonda, Mr. Gandhi said the TRS president should not just stop there. “Dalits and tribals, the 4, 500 farmers who committed suicide during KCR’s governance, unemployed youth and families of martyrs, and all districts should be adopted,” he said.
Telugu Desam Party president and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, who raised the slogan ‘Jai Telangana’ several times, termed as false propaganda the charges levelled by the TRS leaders that he was conspiring against Telangana and was acting with vested interests with an eye on controlling the administration in Telangana or denying the State its due share of water.
‘Not against Telangana’
“Did I stop KCR from making a dalit CM, building 2BHKs, or from coming to Secretariat?” Mr. Naidu asked the audience to the response of a ‘No’ and cries of Jai Telangana.
Condemning arrests of leaders, stifling voices of dissent and protest, the leaders of the People’s Front said the undemocratic ways of the government will become history on December 11, when Mr. Rao becomes a former Chief Minister.
Earlier, addressing campaign meetings in Sattupalli and Aswaraopet constituencies in Khammam district the TDP president said, Telangana, which was revenue surplus at the time of its formation, is now grappling with a huge debt burden due to the TRS misrule.

Leaders of the Mehdavis have expressed support for MIM
The Mehdavi Muslim vote and those from Seemandhra region could play a decisive role in determining the fate of the Malakpet Assembly segment this election season.
The Mehdavi Muslim community is concentrated primarily in areas of the constituency such as Chanchalguda and parts of Azampura. Estimates peg the number of voters from this community at approximately 18,000.
A notable leader from the community was former Chandrayangutta legislator Aman Ullah Khan, who formed the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen breakaway outfit Majlis Bachao Tehreek, belonged to the Mehdavi Muslim community.
In the fray this year are MIM’s Ahmed bin Abdullah Balala and Telugu Desam Party’s Mohammed Muzaffar Ali Khan. The political rivals had locked horns soon after the constituency’s delimitation, in 2009. Also contesting on the BJP ticket is Ale Jeetendra, son of senior BJP leader Ale Narendra, trying hard to make inroads into the constituency, banking on BJP’s traditional vote base.
Owaisi meets murshids
According to sources, MIM president Asaduddin Owaisi met murshids, or faith leaders, of the Mehdavi Muslim community. They are said to have expressed their support to the party. Further, at a recent public meeting, Atan Miyan, a prominent Mehdavi cleric is said to have shared the stage with MIM leaders.
Apart from the Mehdavi community, those in the know said voters who trace their roots to the Seemandhra region number between 8,000 and 10,000. They are said to be residents of areas such as Andhra Colony, Saidabad Colony, SBH Colony and parts of Moosaram Bagh. Both the MIM and the TDP are making efforts to woo them.
With Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu embarked on a road show with senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in Malakpet, Mohammed Muzaffar Ali Khan is said to have received a shot in the arm.
Jamiat equation
But Mehdavis and those from Seemandhra aside, also in the equation is the influential socio-religious organisation Jamiat-e-Ulama Hind - Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
Traditionally supporters of the Congress, the outfit which comprises Muslim clerics, recently affirmed its support for the Congress-TDP-CPI alliance. The Jamiat’s city unit has considerable influence in Saidabad and Akber Bagh areas.
It was in 2004 that Malakpet was a segment of the Nalgonda parliamentary constituency. With over 5.15 lakh voters, Congress candidate M. Ranga Reddy was elected. He beat his nearest rival M. Kishan Reddy of the TDP by over 23,000 votes.
With delimitation, Malakpet had become a segment of the Hyderabad parliamentary seat, a stronghold of the MIM. It was then that Mr. Balala won against Mr. Khan with a margin of 8,371 votes. In 2014, Mr. Khan did not contest the elections. Therefore, the electoral fight then was primarily between Mr. Balala and B. Venkat Reddy of the BJP. Mr. Balala won against Mr. Reddy, his nearest rival, with a margin of over 23,263 votes.

Complainant duped of ₹5.45 lakh
A 30-year-old Nigerian, wanted by the Rachakonda police for matrimonial fraud, was arrested in New Delhi after a city-based divorced woman lodged a cheating complainant with the cyber crime police here.
The accused was identified as Abel Odara from Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh, and a native of Nigeria.
Cyber Crime ACP S. Harinath said the complainant, who was duped for ₹ 5.45 lakh, received a message from a person on www.shaadi.com who identified himself as ‘Dr. Ayush Tyagi’.
When she began chatting with him, the man told her that he was planning to relocate to Hyderabad from abroad to start his own medical clinic. He told the complainant that his wife died in a car accident and that he lives with his daughter.
“The accused told her that he booked tickets to India, shared his travel plan and was to arrive at Mumbai international airport in August,” Mr. Harinath said.
In the first week of August, a lady introducing herself as Pooja from Customs Department at Mumbai airport called the victim stating that Dr. Tyagi was in their custody for laundering money of ₹ 3 crore. “Believing it to be true, she deposited ₹ 5.45 lakh into different bank accounts. Later she came to know that she was cheated by the fraudsters and lodged a complaint,” the officer said.
Following which Odara was arrested in New Delhi and brought to Hyderabad on a transit warrant. They seized four laptops, 13 mobile phones, two passports and other material from his possession.

Document reflects aspirations of citizens and aligned with Resilient Cities Framework
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) became the first party to come out with a manifesto for the city — ‘Vision for Hyderabad 2030’ — to make the capital into an “economically vibrant, environmentally safe, inclusive and a happy city” according to its author Karuna Gopal.
Union Health Minister J.P. Nadda, also the party in-charge for Telangana, and party national general secretary Ram Madhav released the document here on Tuesday.
Ms. Gopal, who was also involved in the framing of the party manifesto, explained that the city-specific plan reflects the aspirations of the citizens and is designed to align with the ‘Resilient Cities Framework’.
Inclusive framework
The inclusive framework ensures four sections of the society — women, senior citizens, differently-abled and the urban poor are heard. The party promises to have city-centric strategies with people-centric approach, public, private people partnerships etc. A periodical report on the city performance will be released containing information about governance, socio-economic profile and health status.
The document aims at creating a vibrant hybrid business ecosystem not just restricted to HiTec City, develop a single integrated master plan for next 20 years, ensure 30% mandatory green cover, open space policy, annual tree census, preservation of parks and so on. Better affordable housing and infrastructure, pollution-free air and water will be priority, including quick and accessible emergency medical care, Ayushman Bharat scheme, making quality medicines available at affordable prices.
Universal access
Focus would be on provision of universal access to the differently-abled persons. The party promises that medical health for infants and children will be accessible and free and mothers would be made aware of nutrition, pre-natal care, immunisation and vaccination. Skill development, reskilling senior citizens, security and safety, age-friendly goods and services, slum-friendly initiatives like housing, nutritious food, decentralised waste management and steps towards zero-waste, etc., round-the-clock water supply and recycling, among others are also promised in the party manifesto. Focus will be on safer roads, public transport like completing MMTS phase two and further extension, making footpaths and zebra lines a must.
Mr. Nadda and Mr. Madhav said the BJP lives in the present and plans for the future. They spoke about the achievements of the Modi government in areas of healthcare and economy promising more by 2022 because they are sure of getting re-elected at the Centre and become the king-maker in Telangana.

Constituencies in Hyderabad district to witness tough fight
Hyderabad capital region was a bone of contention when the State was reorganised in 2014 as the capital city was the economic engine of the combined State with Telugu people from both Andhra and Telangana regions making it their home.
But core Hyderabad district with more than half of its 15 Assembly constituencies being stronghold of AIMIM, always made it tough for other political parties to get their candidates elected from the constituencies located in the Old City. While the neighbouring Ranga Reddy and Medchal -Malkajgiri districts have Seemandhra ‘settlers’ mainly hailing from Andhra region, Hyderabad has non-Telugu settlers- Marwadis, Gujaratis, Maharashtrians and others who made it their home decades ago and not known to be voting on the basis of region.
With 39,60,707 voters in the district, Muslim dominated minorities constituting 18,45,620 voters, the district is one of the highly polarised districts in the State. Analysts say that an interesting scenario is emerging in the district as minority candidates fielded by the Congress -led alliance are giving the MIM candidates a run for their money, at least in two constituencies - Nampally and Malakpet. The People’s Front (Maha Kutami) candidate Mohammad Ferozkhan is pitted against Jaffer Hussein of MIM in Nampally where votes polled by TRS candidate M. Anand Goud and BJP’s Devara Karunakar could become the deciding factor in determining the outcome of the poll.
Triangular fight
In Malakpet, Ahmed Bin Abdullah Balala , the MIM candidate who won the election in 2009 and 2014 is locked in a triangular fight with People’s Front candidate Mohd. Muzaffer Ali Khan, A. Jitendra, son of former BJP leader Ale Narendra, and Chada Satish Kumar of TRS. The alliance candidate could decide the fate of the election on the quantum of minority votes he is likely to secure.
In the 2014 election, AIMIM bagged seven seats - Malakpet, Nampally, Karwan, Charminar, Chandrayangutta, Yakutpura, and Bahadurpura while the BJP won four seats from Musheerabad, Amberpet, Khairatabad and Goshamahal and TDP bagged Jubilee Hills, Sanathnagar and Secunderabad Cantonment and T. Padmarao of TRS won from Secunderabad. All the four TDP candidates have since crossed over to the TRS.
While the Congress drew a blank in the last election, this time round, alliance candidates P. Vishnuvardhan Reddy of Congress from Jubilee Hills and Kuna Venkatesh Goud of TDP from Sanathnagar are locked in a neck and neck contest with their opponent TRS candidates Maganti Gopinath and Talasani Srinivas Yadav respectively.The Khairatabad constituency is witnessing an interesting contest between incumbent C. Ramachandra Reddy of the BJP, Danam Nagender of TRS and Dasoju Sravan of the Congress.
Mr. Nagender is a known face in the constituency and an associate of former Congress leader P. Janardhan Reddy, reputed as PJR. Mr. Sravan is, however, banking on the support of PJR’s followers who constitute a considerable number and their association with PJR’s family remained in tact. Mr. Sravan is said to have succeeded by and large in eliciting the support of PJR’s followers through PJR’s son Vishnuvardhan Reddy who is contesting from the neighbouring Jubilee Hills constituency as the Congress candidate.

A clutch of organisations fighting for farmers’ rights in Telangana today asked tenant farmers to use their votes to secure their rights. “All the parties have released their manifestos. The Telangana Rashtra Samiti has completely ignored the issue of tenant farmers and Adivasi farmers who number about 15 lakh. We are asking them to use their vote as a weapon,” said Kirankumar Vissa of Rhythu Swarajya Vedika at a presser on Tuesday.
“We have had a ‘ missed call’ campaign. We did motorcycle rallies to raise awareness among tenant farmers. Before 2014, TRS had promised 3 acres of land to Dalit farmers, loan waiver scheme, crop insurance and MSP, but these have been completely forgotten now,” said Mr. Vissa.
The farmers’ leaders said the tenant farmers will vote strategically as they number about 15 lakh and can tilt scales the way they want. “There is a groundswell of anger against the govt. When we did a study with the TISS, 75% of the farmers ending their lives were tenant farmers. Their families are not eligible for any compensatory benefits. The farm outreach programmes have touched only a small percentage of farmers,” said B. Kondal of Rythu Swarajya Vedika.

His book is drawn from anecdotes, statistics and RTI information
Member of Parliament from Sultanpur (UP), Varun Gandhi, today shared his ideas for an economic and social transformation of the country at the launch of his book ‘A Rural Manifesto’ in Hyderabad.
The book was peppered with anecdotes, statistics, success stories and information unearthed using RTIs, and presented before students at the Shilpakala Vedika auditorium.
“The British created irrigation facilities in Western Maharashtra and Southern Gujarat. Vidarbha was ignored. Now, cotton farmers have 100% irrigation facilities in Gujarat, while Vidarbha has 9% irrigation. The result is that Vidarbha has the highest suicide rates in the country in farm sector. We need to think differently to solve this problem,” said Mr. Gandhi.
Mr Gandhi said: “It takes ₹ 24 lakh to create one job in the steel sector. And it takes ₹1 lakh to create 24 jobs in garments sector. We have to act smart to use this information. Today, Bangladesh is the fastest growing economy in the region because it is investing 20% of its GDP. We have to plan and innovate to move on.”
Striking a chord with the students with his reference to Telugu scientists in Houston, Mr. Gandhi shared his experiences of visiting a number of places including schools in Kangra, farms in Banda and Harvard University in Massachusetts.
“I sat down to eat at the cafeteria in Houston, Texas. And all I could hear was Telugu. There are 91,000 Indian science and technology PhD holders abroad. In India, the number is around 1000. An Indian PhD holder gets a salary of ₹1 lakh per month. In Europe, US or Australia he gets an equivalent of ₹20 lakh. We need to create systems to keep the smartest in the country,” said Mr. Gandhi as students cheered when he referred to Hyderabad, Machilipatnam and Guntur as the catchment areas for these PhD holders.
